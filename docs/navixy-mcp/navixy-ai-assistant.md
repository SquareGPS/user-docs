# Navixy AI Assistant

Navixy AI Assistant is a chat interface built into the Navixy platform and website. It answers questions about the platform using official documentation, blog articles, and device information, and can query your live account data when opened from the [Navixy platform](https://app.gitbook.com/s/446mKak1zDrGv70ahuYZ/) or [Admin Panel](https://app.gitbook.com/s/KdgeXg71LpaDrwexQYwp/).

You can type your question or speak it aloud. The assistant streams answers in real time and includes links to the sources it used.

You can also use the assistant without signing in at [assistant.navixy.com](https://assistant.navixy.com/).

## What you can ask about your account

When you open the assistant from the Navixy interface or Admin Panel, it automatically connects to your account and can query your live data in the same conversation as documentation.

### From the Navixy interface

{% hint style="info" %}
The assistant must be added to your account via the [User Applications](https://claude.ai/docs/user/guide/account/user-applications.md) feature before it appears in the interface. Contact your service provider if the assistant is not visible.
{% endhint %}

With an active Navixy session, the assistant can access:

* **Trackers and vehicles:** List your trackers, check current states and locations, look up sensor readings, or find a specific object by name.
* **Groups and tags:** List tracker groups, find a group by name, or browse your tags.
* **Track history:** Ask for the route a tracker took during a specific time period.
* **Addresses:** Convert GPS coordinates to a readable address.

Example prompts:

* "Which of my trackers haven't reported in the last hour?"
* "Show me the track for Vehicle 7 from yesterday afternoon."
* "What sensors does tracker "Truck 12" have?"
* "List all trackers in the Warehouse group."

### From the Admin Panel

The assistant is available directly from the left sidebar in the Admin Panel. Select it to open the chat panel. Your session is recognized automatically and no additional login is required.

With an active Admin Panel session, the assistant can access:

* **Users:** List your users with filtering options, or get detailed information about a specific user including their balance, contacts, and tracker count.
* **Trackers:** Browse all trackers across your dealer account, filter by user or tariff plan, or get detailed data for a specific device including its connection status and current tariff.
* **Tariff plans:** Look up available tariff plans with pricing and limits, or get details about a specific plan.
* **Billing and transactions:** View billing transactions for a user within a date range, or check active tracker history by month.
* **Dealer account:** Get information about your dealer tariff, limits, available features, and current balance.

Example prompts:

* "Show me all users with a negative balance."
* "What tariff is tracker 12345 currently on?"

# GPS device certification

In this guide, you’ll learn what GPS tracker certification entails, why it’s important, and which certificates are required in order to sell or use GPS trackers.

Every electronic device on the market is subject to product certification before being sold, and GPS trackers are no different. Just like many other electronic product classes, they need to be approved to show that they meet compliance requirements with respect to customer safety, electromagnetic compatibility, and other regulations set by certain countries.

This article explains what GPS tracker certification entails, and which certificates are required to sell or use these devices in your country. If you have questions, contact Navixy for assistance.

## What is GPS tracker certification?

GPS tracker certification refers to any review process mandated for a device to be sold in a given market. Different national and international bodies, as well as network operators themselves, are responsible for determining that a unit meets minimum safety and technical standards. Devices sold in multiple markets will need to have each region’s required certifications clearly displayed in order to be sold there.

Before you start marketing GPS trackers in a specific region, you need to make sure that the devices you have chosen comply with all local regulations. Failure to meet these standards may result in significant fines to the company or its officials, recalling previously sold devices, and processing customer claims.

The complete certification process of a GPS tracker may consist of several certifications to confirm that the device meets the national standards for safety, wireless compatibility, and security:

1. **Safety requirements**  
Refers to user safety such as electrical safety (e.g., for GPS tracker with AC power adaptors), disclosures of hazardous materials, and communication standards.
2. **Electromagnetic compliance**  
Radio frequencies, bands, and protocols are subject to testing to ensure devices don’t cause interference with other devices when operating.
3. **Cellular operators**  
In some countries, cellular network operators, such as Verizon and AT&T, will certify devices for use on their specific networks. This may be necessary if you use them for your business internet or have SIM cards through their network.
4. **National security**  
To help improve cybersecurity and encryption standards, some countries require ratings for certain products based on risk to ensure consumers are educated about which products are safest to use. In 2023, the US will launch such a labeling program for consumer IoT electronics.

## GPS tracker certification process

Depending on the country, there are different mandatory certification programs in each category. In most cases, these may be completed concurrently, while some may need to be done in a particular sequence. Also, some wireless certifications may require that both the GPS tracker and its emitting components, such as the cellular module, be certified separately.

The organization that defines the standards and procedures for a certification program also lists laboratories that are authorized to perform the actual tests. It’s often required for manufacturers to provide a lab with 1-2 GPS tracker samples and relevant documentation. Any changes to the design of the hardware usually necessitates recertification.

Applicant eligibility is also defined in the certification documents. Typically, the device manufacturer initiates the process but in many cases it may be a company that has established relationships with the manufacturer, such as authorized distributors or resellers, or even end customers in some instances.

After successfully passing all tests, the device is issued an official certificate or a notice of certification by the authorized organization as evidence that it complies with the requirements. In addition, the certified GPS tracker is often listed in a publicly accessible registry. Most certifications that are regulated by the government require that the official certification mark or identification number is displayed on the device, package, and user manuals.

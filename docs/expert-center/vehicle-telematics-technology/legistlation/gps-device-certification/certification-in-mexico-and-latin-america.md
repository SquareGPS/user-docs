# Certification in Mexico and Latin America

Several international entities conduct standardization tests for GPS device certification to ensure that trackers meet safety and operation standards. These organizations give their approval and grant certified devices their distinctive seal as a guarantee of quality and durability.

Although most countries approve equivalents or use the international standards established by the United States, Canada, and the European Union, each country may require mandatory or voluntary standards depending on the type of device to be imported and marketed.

Find out more about some of the organizations in Mexico and Latin America that manufacturers take as a reference to certify their equipment.

For more information, please contact the relevant organizations.

## GPS devices certification in Mexico and LATAM

After certification, a product may need to display certain agencies’ markings or certificate ID on the packaging, manual, and device itself. This ensures that any potential buyer knows exactly which certifications a device might have. Users can also access the corresponding databases, if available, and search by ID number for additional product information such as test reports, frequency bands, and applicant details.

## Cellular network compliance

In addition to the various national and international bodies that issue certifications, wireless cellular and data providers may also certify devices for use on their networks. These are generally optional, and are only required if a company plans to operate solely with a specific provider’s network.

## SIM/operators

Since most trackers use a universal SIM card, certification isn’t an issue. Many of the businesses that provide universal SIMs also have deals to access cell towers owned by carriers for roaming and additional capacity. However, if a device has a SIM card from a specific carrier, like AT\&T or T-Mobile, then the tracker needs to be certified to operate on its network. &#x20;

Some alliances between manufacturers and carriers “lock” the devices to only operate with their SIM. If you want to use this equipment with another operator, you would have to consult the corresponding process to “unlock” it.

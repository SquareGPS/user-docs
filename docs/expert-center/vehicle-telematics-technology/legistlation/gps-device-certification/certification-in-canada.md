## Required certification labels in Canada

Products need to display all relevant markings from each agency that issues a certification. In Canada, the device may bear the former IC label or simply the newer ISED ID number, depending on when the tracker was certified. The latter allows you to search the ISED database for additional details about the tests, product documentation, and more.

The country’s Radio Standards Specifications define the standards for approval, while Foreign Certification Bodies (FCBs) certify products outside of Canada and issue Technical Acceptance Certificates for all approved devices. This certificate is required to enter the Canadian market.<br><br>Note: Prior FCC approval can help expedite ISED certification. |

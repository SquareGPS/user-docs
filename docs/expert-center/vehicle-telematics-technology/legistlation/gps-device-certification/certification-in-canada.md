## Required certification labels in Canada

Products need to display all relevant markings from each agency that issues a certification. In Canada, the device may bear the former IC label or simply the newer ISED ID number, depending on when the tracker was certified. The latter allows you to search the ISED database for additional details about the tests, product documentation, and more.

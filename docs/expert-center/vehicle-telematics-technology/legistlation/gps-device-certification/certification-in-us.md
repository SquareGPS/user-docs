1**Common industry wireless certification requirements.** PTCRB and GFC are two widely recognized organizations that certify devices based on 3GPP logic meet device-network interoperability standards. Whereas AT&T, T-Mobile, and U.S. Cellular all require PTCRB certification for their programs, Verizon requires GFC certification.

## Required certification labels in the US

After certification, a product may need to display certain agencies’ markings or certificate ID on the packaging, manual, and device itself. This ensures that any potential buyer knows exactly which certifications a device has. They can also access the FCC’s database and search by ID number for additional product information, such as test reports, frequency bands, and applicant details.

| UL  | ![Certification in the US](https://www.navixy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ul.png) | ✓   |     | In the US, UL (Underwriters Laboratories) tests a wide array of products for safety and technical standards, including IoT devices. These tests can help manufacturers discover potential problems before a product goes to market. UL approval may also be required for FCC and other certifications, although it’s typically optional for market entry. |

## Cybersecurity certification for IoT devices in 2023

Beginning in 2023, the United States will require consumer IoT products to display a risk rating. Implemented due to the increase of IoT product use and the significant cybersecurity risk posed by poor device security, the initiative is intended to help better educate consumers on product safety when shopping for smart home devices, personal GPS trackers, and other IoT electronics. The program is based partially on the Energy Star rating, which scores products based on energy efficiency.

Essentially, the rating will indicate if the device meets standards set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Moreover, people will be able to scan a barcode on the label to access more information on software updating policies, data encryption, and addressing vulnerabilities.

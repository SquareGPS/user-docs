Understanding of DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Codes) is vital for effective fleet management and telematics in general. Vehicle codes serve as your car's language, conveying its health status and notifying you of possible issues.

DTC codes are universally used across all types of vehicles, from small cars to large commercial cargo vans. Certain DTCs can trigger your check engine light (officially known as the malfunction indicator lamp or MIL) to turn on. Possible triggers range from serious concerns like engine overheating or brake failure, to minor issues such as air bag system glitches or a loose gas cap. However, it's important to remember that the light itself doesn't give you the specifics of the problem.

Navixy will guide you through the world of DTC codes. Learn how they work, the types you may encounter, how to obtain them, and receive human-readable definitions.

## What is a DTC code?

These are five-digit alphanumeric codes that your vehicle's onboard diagnostics (OBD) computer generates when there's a hiccup in the system.

Built into most vehicles, OBD systems act like early warning systems, alerting you to potential car troubles before they escalate. The first standardized DTCs were designed by the Society of Automotive Engineers' (SAE) vehicle manufacturers. Their primary purpose was to keep an eye on a vehicle's emissions and send alerts if emissions exceeded legal limits.

Nowadays, vehicles are equipped with a wide range of DTCs that monitor various aspects, from the powertrain to the passenger compartment.

When a DTC is triggered, your vehicle sends up a flare: the check engine light illuminates, signaling an issue that requires your attention. To diagnose the problem, read the specific DTC code(s) provided by the vehicle's OBD system. This system acts as a computerized "black box" with a network of sensors that diligently monitors your vehicle's health and performance.

## How are DTC codes generated?

Picture the OBD as your vehicle's personal doctor, always on call, monitoring its health. In the early 90s, we had OBD-I systems, which communicated in two-digit DTCs. However, these codes weren't universal and varied from one car brand to another.

Fast forward to 1996, and the OBD-II systems became standard in all US cars. The language they spoke? Standardized DTC codes. Sure, some manufacturers added their unique flair, but the core OBD-II DTC codes remained the same across the board - a legal necessity.

The OBD-II system operates like this: It receives signals from a network of sensors throughout your vehicle. It's a bit like a detective, analyzing these signals to determine whether a DTC should be activated.

But what if the OBD-II senses a minor glitch that lasts only a moment? Will it set off the dreaded check engine light? Not necessarily. OBD-II has some built-in "debouncing" rules to prevent false alarms.

Take starting your vehicle's ignition as an example. The engine needs a few seconds to warm up. You wouldn't want the OBD-II to flag a DTC just because it detected a slight delay in one of the car's parts at startup. To avoid this, the OBD-II follows rules that trigger a DTC code only if the system detects a fault lasting for a specific duration or happening a certain number of times.

Once a genuine fault passes the OBD-II's debouncing rules, that verified fault gets stored in the OBD-II's memory, like a detective noting down evidence. This activates your check engine light, and it stays on until the issue is fixed.

So, when you see your check engine light turn on, it's typically not a random event.

Lastly, keep in mind that your OBD-II system can detect multiple DTCs simultaneously. This means that sometimes, a lit-up check engine light could indicate several messages waiting for you in your OBD scan tool (but we'll delve deeper into this later).

## **Decoding the DTC Characters**

DTC codes are neatly organized into four main categories, each designated by the first character of the code.

1. **P (Powertrain)**: These codes speak to the heart of your vehicle — the engine, transmission, fuel system, ignition, and other drivetrain components. Think of them as the pulse of your vehicle's throttle.
2. **B (Body)**: These codes are all about comfort and safety within the driver's passenger compartment, from seat belts and airbags to the air conditioning system.
3. **C (Chassis)**: These codes pertain to the mechanical skeleton of your vehicle, including steering, suspension, tires, and brakes.
4. **U (Network)**: These codes are related to the vehicle's onboard computer (OBD) and its network of connected sensors and wiring.

The second character in your DTC code indicates whether it's a standardized SAE code (0) or unique to the manufacturer (1). If you stumble upon a manufacturer-specific code, you'll need to dig into the vehicle manufacturer's information for further insights.

When dealing with a standard DTC code (second character is 0), the third character (ranging from 0-8) clues you into the affected subsystem:

When the code’s second character (see above) is a 0 — meaning your DTC code is standard — the third character in the code (0-8) indicates which subsystem in the vehicle is affected:

- 0 – Fuel and air metering, along with auxiliary emission control
- 1 – Fuel and air metering
- 2 – Injector circuit malfunctions in fuel and air metering
- 3 – Ignition system or misfire issues
- 4 – Emission control system
- 5 – Vehicle speed control, idle control system, auxiliary inputs
- 6 – Computer circuits
- 7-8 – Transmission

The final two characters in the DTC are a two-digit fault index number, pinpointing the specific issue within the subsystem. These numbers range from 0 to 99.

## **DTC Code examples in action**

Powertrain (P) codes are quite common, so let's break down two of these: P0420 and P0430. Both codes flag an issue with the vehicle's catalytic converter. Here's how to read them:

- P – Powertrain
- 0 – Standard SAE Code
- 4 – Emission Control System
- 20/30 – Catalyst System Low Efficiency Bank 1 and 2

The bank number refers to the engine side where the fault was detected. Both codes imply that the catalytic converter isn't optimally converting harmful emission gases into acceptable ones. While this won't cause your vehicle to implode on the spot, you'll need to address this issue to pass a vehicle emissions inspection.

## **Extracting DTC Codes**

There are two primary ways to tap into your vehicle's communication system:

- **OBD Scanners**: A go-to tool for mechanics, OBD scanners are a straightforward way to access DTC codes. Simply plug the scanner into your vehicle’s OBD-II connector (usually located under the steering wheel), and voila — you'll have direct access to DTC information from the onboard computer. Not the most modern way.
- **Telematics Systems**: Many newer vehicles may be equipped with telematics systems also known as [OBD trackers](https://www.navixy.com/blog/top-obd-trackers-2023/). You can install it easily into the vehicle’s OBD-II connector. With OBD-II trackers, we bring DTC codes and their interpretations right to your fingertips on the Navixy platform.

## How to get DTC codes reading on Navixy

To get the full potential of Navixy's DTC code reading capabilities, you'll need to ensure two things:

- Your GPS tracker supports sending DTC codes.
- Your vehicle is compatible with the GPS tracker in question.
- The platform supports reading of DTC codes from this device. You can check on our website with [supported devices](https://www.navixy.com/devices/).

Once these conditions are met, configure your device to send DTC codes to the Navixy platform. You won't need to add specific sensors or engage in complicated configurations for DTC codes. They will automatically appear in widgets once the platform starts receiving them.

To interpret these messages from your vehicle, refer to a table of definitions. This will help you unlock what your vehicle is trying to communicate, helping you to take appropriate action.

## Generic DTC codes definitions table

As explained earlier, general DTCs start with P0XXX, and manufacturer exclusive DTCs start with P1XXX. Generic DTCs are defined in the standards for OBD 2 and EOBD 2, and applies to all official car manufacturers.

# Vehicle Video Telematics Device Compliance: What You Need to Know

Video telematics devices—dash cams, driver-facing cameras, and advanced telematics recorders—are becoming common in both personal vehicles and commercial fleets. They can improve driver safety, help with insurance claims, and provide transparency in case of disputes.

But their installation and use involve **complex compliance requirements**. Laws vary between the **federal** and **state level**, and California in particular enforces **stricter standards**. International rules, like those under the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), add another layer for global fleets.

This article covers the essentials of what you need to know.

### **Federal Regulations** <a href="#nlepb9ou1661" id="nlepb9ou1661"></a>

While there’s no single federal statute banning or approving dash cams, several regulations matter:

1. **Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS)**
   * Devices must not obstruct a driver’s clear view.
   * Improper placement can be considered a violation of **NHTSA visibility rules**.
2. **FMCSA §393.60(e) (Commercial Vehicles)**
   * Specific to **commercial motor vehicles (CMVs)**.
   * “Vehicle safety technologies” such as cameras may be mounted on the windshield **if within the wiper-swept area** and **outside the driver’s sight lines**.
   * Compliance often requires marking the windshield during installation to avoid mistakes.
3. **Federal Communications Commission (FCC)**
   * Devices that transmit data wirelessly must comply with FCC rules to avoid interfering with GPS, CB radios, or emergency communications.
4. **Privacy & Data Handling**
   * While the **Driver’s Privacy Protection Act (DPPA)** covers DMV records, telematics data falls into a gray zone. Operators are expected to safeguard recordings and avoid unauthorized sharing to minimize liability.\


### **California: Stricter Than Most** <a href="#id-8ar37m4i9rst" id="id-8ar37m4i9rst"></a>

California stands apart with tighter restrictions:

1. **Windshield Mounting (CVC §26708)**
   * Devices are only allowed in three zones:
     * A **7-inch square** in the lower passenger corner.
     * A **5-inch square** in the lower driver corner.
     * A **5-inch square** behind the rearview mirror at the top center.
2. **Two-Party Consent (Penal Code §632)**
   * Audio recording requires consent from **everyone recorded**.
   * Applies equally to passengers and employees in commercial vehicles.
3. **Employee & Passenger Privacy**
   * California law gives individuals stronger privacy rights. Employers must disclose monitoring and avoid recording during breaks or in contexts where privacy is expected.\


### **Other State-Level and International Rules** <a href="#ejf73jttbz6b" id="ejf73jttbz6b"></a>

* **Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)**
  * Prohibits collecting biometric identifiers (like facial geometry for driver-monitoring AI) without explicit, informed consent.
  * Litigation against companies has already occurred under this law.
* **Other U.S. States**: Texas and Washington also regulate biometric data.
* **UK & EU (GDPR/ICO)**
  * Require Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs), clear signage in vehicles, and strict retention limits.
  * Non-compliance can result in steep penalties.\


### **Data Retention and Evidence Handling** <a href="#id-66jr4lse42ae" id="id-66jr4lse42ae"></a>

Compliance is not just about placement and consent. It also extends to **how data is managed**:

* **Retention Limits**: Store recordings only as long as necessary for safety or claims.
* **Chain of Custody**: Courts demand proof that video is authentic and untampered.
  * Features like **timestamps, audit logs, tamper seals, hash values, and watermarking** help ensure evidence is admissible.\


### **Compliance Checklist** <a href="#iks08ovt82wo" id="iks08ovt82wo"></a>

Here’s a quick checklist for staying compliant with video telematics installation and usage:

| **Category**                                                | **Key Requirements**                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Federal Placement (FMVSS / FMCSA §393.60(e))**            | Devices must not obstruct view; commercial fleets may mount cameras in wiper-swept area outside sight lines. |
| **California Placement (CVC §26708)**                       | Only allowed in small zones: 7” passenger corner, 5” driver corner, or 5” behind rearview mirror.            |
| **Audio Recording**                                         | Two-party consent required in California and \~12 other states; one-party consent suffices elsewhere.        |
| **Biometric Data (e.g., facial recognition, eye tracking)** | Illinois BIPA and similar state laws require explicit consent; avoid or disable if not compliant.            |
| **Employee & Passenger Privacy**                            | Notify all drivers/passengers; limit recording during breaks or off-duty use.                                |
| **International (GDPR/ICO)**                                | Requires DPIAs, signage, and strict retention policies.                                                      |
| **Data Retention**                                          | Keep recordings only as long as needed; define policies for secure deletion.                                 |
| **Evidence Chain of Custody**                               | Use logs, hashes, and watermarking to prove authenticity.                                                    |
| **Wireless Transmission**                                   | Must comply with FCC standards for interference.                                                             |

### **Final Thoughts** <a href="#id-11tsqlxtvvv8" id="id-11tsqlxtvvv8"></a>

Video telematics devices are **legal nationwide**, but compliance requires more than just turning them on. Between **federal visibility rules, state-specific privacy laws, biometric consent requirements, and international data protection standards**, it’s a patchwork landscape.

For drivers and fleets alike, the safest approach is to:

* Install devices only in legally permitted zones.
* Be transparent about recording and obtain consent when required.
* Limit data retention and secure stored footage.
* Stay alert to evolving state and international regulations.

Done right, video telematics can deliver **safety, efficiency, and peace of mind**—without the legal risk.

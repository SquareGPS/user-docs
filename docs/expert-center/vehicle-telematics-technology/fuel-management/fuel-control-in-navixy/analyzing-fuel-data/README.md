# Analyzing fuel data

The platform instantly captures and stores fuel sensor readings from connected devices. Data is saved only after the creation of a fuel sensor within the system.

Filters for minimum and maximum values, calibration tables, and other sensor settings are applied during data output. As a result, you have the freedom to modify settings anytime and reconstruct reports to observe the impact on saved data. This configuration flexibility ensures your data is always synchronized with the latest settings, keeping it consistently up-to-date.

# X-GPS Tracker mobile app

X-GPS Tracker application requires several permissions to operate correctly.

95% of issues with tracks or work in the background are a result of incorrect setup of the phone.  
Privacy is one of the most precious things in the current world so it's not unusual for companies to prevent apps from actively recording data.  
Running an open app is one set of permissions, running in the background - another one, running when the screen is locked is one more, and so on.

Systems might limit the usage of resources, especially in the background. For these reasons, you need to ensure your phone is setup correctly.

The generic settings are set up during [initial activation](https://www.navixy.com/docs/user/mobile-view/x-gps-tracker/first-start/) process. However, the availability of settings depends on the OS version and phone manufacturer, and model. So your phone might have settings that are model-specific and aren't set by default.

### What setting do I need to setup?

In general, permissions can be set into several groups:

#### GPS location

Most phones allow user to set custom location permissions for each app. To ensure correct work of X-GPS Tracker please check that location is enabled for the app and is allowed always, not only when the app is open.

#### Battery usage

Most phones offer battery optimization settings and white lists.  
please make sure your X-GPS Tracker app is exempt from battery optimization. If there is such feature - app has to be white-listed for low battery modes.

#### Network access

App must have access to Cellular data with no data caps. This will ensure your app will be able to transfer data.

#### Background work

Some manufacturers limit which apps can and cannot work in the background. If your phone has this feature - please whitelist it. Huawei is the most notorious for this.

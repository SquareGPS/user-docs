# Integrate IoT Data from Servers and Gateways

Navixy can receive telematics data not only directly from devices but also through supported retranslating protocols from other platforms and gateways. This allows for a flexible and comprehensive approach to data integration, ensuring compatibility with various services.

Navixy supports multiple protocols:

* [Wialon](wialon-protocols-for-data-ingestion.md)**:** Wialon Retranslator, Wialon Combine, and Wialon IPS.

Each protocol has its unique capabilities, allowing users to transmit a wide range of data and telemetry to the Navixy platform.

# How to Implement Event-Driven Scheduling Using Unix Time in IoT Logic

In this section, we will configure a timer in IoT Logic to control the activation of outputs on the devices. This will function as a scheduler by utilizing Unix time for time-based control.

First, the scheduler logic was built based on Unix time, since it is the only reliable and consistent parameter we can always depend on. The second key element is the timestamp of valid packets received by the platform.\
It is important to note that this logic requires the device to continuously send valid data packets to the platform. The frequency itself is not critical; however, if no incoming messages are received, it becomes impossible to evaluate time or trigger any scheduled actions.

\
Now, moving on to the implemented logic attribute calculation node.\
This node retrieves:

* The current event time (current\_time) from the latest packet
* The previous event time (prev\_time) from the prior packet

Both values are converted from milliseconds to seconds.<br>

It is important to note that **genTime** is provided in Unix time (milliseconds) and must be divided by 1000 to obtain the Unix time in seconds, which is the format we will use for all calculations.

\
From these, the system calculates:

* current\_sod (seconds of day)
* prev\_sod (seconds of day for the previous packet)

This is done using the module operation, which extracts the number of seconds elapsed since midnight, effectively converting Unix time into a time-of-day reference.

<pre><code><strong>time % 86400
</strong></code></pre>

A time offset may be observed in these formulas. This offset is determined by the UTC timezone in which the calculations are performed.

In the test scenario, the calculations were conducted in UTC -6, resulting in a 6-hour difference. When converted to seconds, this equals:\
6 hours × 60 min × 60 sec = 21,600 seconds.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
current_sod = (current_time - offset_time) % 86400
prev_sod = (prev_time - offset_time) % 86400
```
{% endcode %}

\
Using these values, the system detects time transitions, not continuous states.

\
For example:

*   Switch ON condition (e.g., 8 PM):The system checks when time crosses the threshold:

    <pre data-overflow="wrap"><code>prev_sod &#x3C; 72000 AND current_sod >= 72000
    </code></pre>
*   Switch OFF condition (e.g., 5 AM):

    <pre data-overflow="wrap"><code>prev_sod &#x3C; 18000 AND current_sod >= 18000
    </code></pre>

This ensures that the action is triggered only once at the moment of transition, rather than continuously during the entire time window.&#x20;

\
Once the logic is met, the action node will trigger the output command to change the output state.\
Some limitations may arise throughout this flow, and it is important to highlight them so they can be taken into consideration:<br>

* **Dependent on incoming data:**

If the device stops sending data, no actions will be triggered. This is why continuous monitoring of the unit is required. If the device is disconnected, jammed, or in sleep mode without sending valid data, the state change will never be detected.<br>

* **No exact execution time guarantee:**

Actions are executed when the next data packet arrives after the threshold is met, not exactly at the scheduled time. For example, if the device reports every 5 minutes and the last packet was received at 20:58, the next message will arrive at 21:03. At that moment, the logic will be fulfilled and the action (e.g., output activation) will be triggered.<br>

* **Timezone handling required:**

Since Unix time is in UTC, an offset must be applied to align it with the desired local time.<br>

* **No persistent scheduling state:**

The system does not store future trigger times; it relies entirely on real-time comparisons between consecutive incoming packets.

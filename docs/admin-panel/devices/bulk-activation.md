# Bulk activation

If you are transferring a large number of GPS devices from another platform to Navixy, it can be a daunting task to activate each device manually. That's where bulk activation comes in handy. With this feature, you can register hundreds or even thousands of devices with just a single CSV or Excel file. Before you begin, please ensure that your CSV file contains the following columns in the specified order:

- user\_id
- model
- label
- device\_id
- phone
- apn\_name
- apn\_user
- apn\_password
- comment

If the devices need to assigned to different users, fill in the `user_id` column. In case of a file without `user_id`, all devices will be added to a single user. Please avoid using special characters such as "+", "°", or double spaces in the file. The comment field is optional and can be used to add additional information about a device. We also provide a [file example](https://www.navixy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/hardware-trackers-activation-example.csv) to guide you with the format.

Once the bulk upload file has been created, please reach out to Navixy’s Support team to assist further with the upload.

Please note that the minimum bulk upload amount is 30 devices.

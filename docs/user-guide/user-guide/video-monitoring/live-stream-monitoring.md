# Live stream monitoring

The live stream feature allows you to view the current situation from your dash cams or MDVR devices and their cameras in real time. Each camera on your device is represented as a channel, enabling you to monitor different perspectives such as the vehicle's interior and the road ahead.

To use the live stream feature, follow these steps:

1. **Access the live stream**: If the device is online, you will see the video icon in the corner of the object widget. Click on this icon to start viewing the live stream.
2. **Start the live stream**: Press the Play button to initiate the live stream.
3. **Use player controls**: Utilize the player progress control to rewind and see what happened several minutes ago. To return to the real-time view, press the “Live” button.
4. **Manage data usage**: Video streaming consumes significant data traffic. To conserve bandwidth, the platform automatically stops the stream when you close the video window or navigate to another module. For most browsers, closing the tab will also stop the stream, though some browser extensions may interfere with this function.

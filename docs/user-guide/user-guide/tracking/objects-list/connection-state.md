# Connection state

Every GPS device in Navixy has a status that indicates its current connection state to the server. These statuses are color-coded and visible in the [Objects list](./). This state does not necessarily mean the device is broken; itâ€™s merely a visualization of the timing of data the platform receives from a device.

Color-coded indicators provide a quick and easy way for users to assess the status of their GPS devices at a glance.

The following table outlines the possible statuses for GPS devices, providing a description of each status and what it signifies about the deviceâ€™s connection and activity. This information helps users understand the real-time condition of their devices, identify any issues, and take appropriate actions to ensure optimal performance.

## Connection state sequence

The diagram below illustrates the sequence of connection statuses for a successfully activated GPS device on the platform, showing the transitions between different states based on the data received and the time elapsed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

* Initially, the device is **Online**, indicated by a green circle, meaning it is connected to the server and transmitting valid GPS coordinates and a timestamp. If no new GPS coordinates or data are received for 5 minutes, the status changes to **GPS not updated**, represented by a green circle with a hole. This can happen if the device loses GPS signal, enters power-saving mode, or sends outdated data from its memory.
* If the connection timeout period (as set by the user or 10 minutes by default) is reached without receiving any new data, the status changes to **Offline**, shown as a red circle. This may occur if the device is in an area with a poor cellular signal, in deep sleep mode, has issues like SIM card problems, or reached the SIM data limit.
* When the device resumes sending valid GPS coordinates and timestamp, the status reverts to **Online**, and the cycle repeats as long as the device operates, transitioning between statuses based on the data received and the elapsed time.

This sequence helps users monitor their GPS devices' real-time connectivity and data transmission status, ensuring timely action can be taken if any issues arise.

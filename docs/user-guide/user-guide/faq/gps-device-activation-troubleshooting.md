# GPS device activation troubleshooting

Activating GPS tracking devices on the Navixy platform is usually straightforward thanks to [automatic device activation](../quick-start/activate-gps-device.md). However, if you encounter issues, this guide will help you troubleshoot and resolve common device activation problems.

### **Device Time Zone settings differ from UTC+0h**

Ensure that GPS tracking devices are set to UTC+0h to avoid data misinterpretation by the Navixy server. Reconfigure any manually set or previously connected devices to UTC+0h before activation on Navixy.

**Issue:**\
When the Navixy server software receives data from a GPS tracking device, the data comes with a timestamp. The server processes this data based on the user’s time zone preferences, ensuring accurate track details and reporting across different time zones. However, the server expects all device data to be in UTC+0h. Manually configured devices or devices previously connected to another platform may have a different time zone, causing Navixy to misinterpret timestamps, potentially marking the data as outdated or faulty.

**Solution:**\
For accurate data processing and display, all GPS tracking devices must be configured to UTC+0h. If the device is not set to UTC+0h, the Navixy server might interpret the data incorrectly, affecting the reliability of track details and reporting.

**Recommendations for Troubleshooting:**

1. Ensure the device is set to UTC+0h before activating it on Navixy.
2. Avoid setting the local time zone on the device.

### Configuration is protected with password or master number

If the device has custom settings such as passwords or master phone numbers, it may prevent automatic configuration by Navixy, leading to activation failures. Remove any custom passwords or master numbers before attempting automatic activation.

<details>

<summary>Read more</summary>

**Issue:**\
During device activation, the Navixy platform sends configuration SMS commands to the device from the service phone number. If the device was previously configured to receive configuration commands from a dedicated master number or if a custom password was set, these commands might fail, leading to unsuccessful activation.

**Solution:**\
To allow automatic activation, remove any custom passwords or master numbers from the device. Alternatively, manually configure the device using the appropriate activation commands.

**Recommendations for Troubleshooting:**

* Remove any custom passwords or master numbers from the device before attempting automatic activation.

### Teltonika and Ruptela leading space issue with automatic activation

Ensure proper configuration for Teltonika and Ruptela devices to avoid issues with leading spaces in SMS commands. Configure the devices [manually](../quick-start/activate-gps-device.md#activate-gps-device-manually) or check with your service provider for the possibility of using another SMS gateway that is optimized for M2M communication.

<details>

<summary>Read more</summary>

**Issue:**\
During automatic activation of Teltonika and Ruptela devices, users may encounter problems due to leading spaces being removed by some SMS gateways. These devices expect a user and password preceding the command, like `<login> <password> command`. When login and password are not set (as recommended), this results in double leading spaces `command`. Some SMS gateways, not optimized for M2M communication, trim these spaces, causing the commands to be unrecognized by the devices.

**Solution:**\
To resolve this issue, either reach out to your service provider to substitute the SMS gateway or manually configure these devices via Teltonika or Ruptela configuration software using the Navixy server IP and port details.

**Recommendations for Troubleshooting:**

* [Manually configure the devices](../quick-start/activate-gps-device.md#activate-gps-device-manually) using the configuration software.
* Contact your service provider to use an SMS gateway optimized for M2M communication that preserves leading spaces.

### SIM card has no phone number

[Automatic device activation process](../quick-start/activate-gps-device.md#activate-gps-device-automatically) requires entering a SIM card's phone number, but SIM cards for M2M communication might not have one. In this case, [manually configure the device](../quick-start/activate-gps-device.md#activate-gps-device-manually) and enter the device IMEI (or any arbitrary set of digits) as the phone number in the activation dialog. Alternatively, contact your service provider to request integration with the MVNO platform for enabling communication using ICCID.

<details>

<summary>Read more</summary>

**Issue:**

When using M2M SIM cards from MVNO providers, they often don’t have associated phone numbers. Instead, these SIM cards are identified through other identifiers, most commonly ICCID. As a result, configuration commands can’t be sent via a common SMS gateway as with normal SIM cards. This leads to challenges in device activation and communication.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you have two options: [manually configure the device](../quick-start/activate-gps-device.md#activate-gps-device-manually) and place the device IMEI (or any arbitrary set of digits) as the phone number in the activation dialog, or reach out to your [service provider](../quick-start/about-service-providers.md) to request integration with the MVNO platform, enabling bi-directional communication over SMS using ICCID instead of a phone number.

**Recommendations for Troubleshooting:**

* [Manually configure the device](../quick-start/activate-gps-device.md#activate-gps-device-manually) and enter the device IMEI as the phone number in the activation dialog.
* [Contact your server provider](../quick-start/about-service-providers.md) to request integration with the MVNO platform for enabling communication using ICCID.

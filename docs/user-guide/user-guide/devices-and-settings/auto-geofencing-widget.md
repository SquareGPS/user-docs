# Auto-geofencing widget

Auto-geofencing, also known as unauthorized movement detection, is a feature available in many vehicle GPS trackers. When the ignition is off and the tracker detects GPS coordinates outside a pre-defined auto-geofence zone, it indicates that the vehicle is leaving its designated parking area.

The GPS tracker will then immediately generate an event and send it to the Navixy platform. Users can configure notifications for [Auto-geofencing events](https://squaregps.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/USERDOCSOLD/pages/2909012515/Auto-geofencing+widget).

## Configuring Auto-geofencing

In the **Devices and settings** section of Navixy, there is a dedicated panel for configuring the auto geofencing feature. Here, you can:

* **Set the time delay after ignition is switched off**: Define how long after the ignition is turned off before the auto-geofencing feature becomes active.
* **Define the radius for triggering**: Specify the distance from the parking location within which movement will trigger the auto-geofencing event.

These settings allow for precise control over when and where the auto-geofencing feature activates, ensuring vehicles remain secure even when unattended.

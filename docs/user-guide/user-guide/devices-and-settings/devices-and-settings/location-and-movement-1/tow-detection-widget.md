# Tow detection widget

The **Tow detection feature**, available in many vehicle GPS devices, is designed to detect unauthorized movement based on signals from the built-in motion sensor. Once the vehicle's ignition is switched off, the sensor enters active mode, continuously monitoring for vibrations, impacts, or movement. If any of these are detected, a notification is immediately sent to the platform from the device and can be reported to the user as configured in [Rules and notifications](../../../rules-and-notifications/rules-and-notifications/security-1/unauthorized-movement.md).

In Navixy software, you can configure this function by accessing the **"Tow detection"** widget in the **"Devices and settings"** section. This panel allows you to adjust the motion sensor sensitivity and specify the time delay before detection begins.

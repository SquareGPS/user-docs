### What is Recurso Confiable?

With the Recurso Confiable protocol, enterprise partners can transfer GPS tracking data safely and reliably into a single location to optimize fleet management processes. This allows the client a way to work and communicate with other Recurso Confiable partners.

When developing this protocol, Navixy took into account the needs of large logistics and retail companies. Companies can streamline important fleet management and GPS tracking platform data and capabilities such as control systems, trip planning, tracking in real-time, predictive modeling reporting, geofence implementation and editing, route optimization, and more. Companies previously disconnected from one another on the Recurso Confiable network are now able to communicate efficiently and quickly.

7. Next, the retranslator will need to be linked to the device on the Recurso Confiable side. To do so, select the **Link** <img src="https://www.navixy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-3.png" alt="link image" data-size="line"> button in the data forwarding widget. Select the retranslator to be connected, and click **Link** below.
8. Next, add information needed to identify the device on Recurso Confiable in the External ID field either by clicking the pencil icon or the external ID field itself. This value should include the following from the Recurso Confiable side, where only the License Plate is mandatory:

The format for the External ID field will be separated by a pipe. For example:

```

```

If only the License Plate is available, the External ID can be entered by itself:

```

```

Or if any other information is missing, be sure to include the pipes, for example:

```
ABC123||123|
```

9. Select **Save** once completed.

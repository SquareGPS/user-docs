## Phone number

The GSM network is used for communicating a terminal with the data center (server), mainly GPRS/EDGE-communication channels and the SMS channel. For this purpose, SIM cards are required in GPS devices. It can be a SIM card purchased from any telecom operator or a SIM card purchased with a device, provided by the operator of monitoring services.

If you need to change the SIM card in the device, you will need to update the phone number to change the settings. You can do this in the appropriate panel:

1. Open the panel and click **Change phone number**.
2. Specify the phone number of a SIM card installed in the tracker.
3. Enter the APN settings of the new service provider.
4. After entering the settings, click **Save,** and the SMS command with specified settings will be sent to the SIM card.

# Forms

**Forms** are electronic documents that can be attached to tasks, allowing employees to submit task results directly through the **X-GPS Tracker** mobile app. These forms can include various types of fields such as text fields for client orders, inspection reports, and media sections for uploading photos and videos.

## Getting started

### Create a form

To begin using forms in Navixy:

1. Open the **Field service** module from the main menu.
2. Click on the **Forms** tab to open the form management interface.
3. Start the form creation process by clicking the **+** icon.
4. Choose the necessary components (e.g., text fields, checkboxes, dropdowns, date, rating, image, file attachment, signature, and section separators) from the left side of the screen. Customize the form to suit your company's specific workflow and tasks.

This process allows you to create as many forms as needed, ensuring they are tailored to the tasks your employees perform.

Two toggles are available when creating a form:

* **"Use by default when creating a task"**: If enabled, this form will automatically be attached to new tasks unless another form is selected. In the form list, this form will be marked with a “star” sign.
* **"Submit form only in the zone"**: If enabled, the form can only be submitted when the employee is within a predefined geographic zone, ensuring that task reporting occurs at the correct location.

After saving, created forms can be accessed in the form list.

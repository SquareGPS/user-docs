To access the Staff section, log in to the Navixy platform and select "Field service" from the main menu. From there, click on the "Staff" tab. This section provides an overview of all employees in your organization, displaying their essential information in a list format.

## List of employees

The employee list is designed for fast and convenient management of your workforce. It is especially useful in conjunction with the "[Tasks](tasks.md)" application, where you can easily assign tasks, communicate with employees, and monitor their progress.

Each employee's information includes the following details:

* **Employee name:** Basic identification information for each employee.
* **Photo:** A profile picture for easy visual identification.
* **Phone and email:** Contact details that allow for quick communication directly through the app.
* **Location address:** The employee's primary location, which may differ from the office or branch address.
* **Driver license information:** Essential for employees who drive as part of their job.
* **Department:** Indicates the department or branch to which the employee belongs.

The list view can be customized by adding or removing columns to display the most relevant information, such as driver license details, employee ID, hardware key, and more.

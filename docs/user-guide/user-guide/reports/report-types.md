# Report types

Navixy provides a comprehensive suite of reports that allow you to monitor various aspects of your fleet’s operations. These reports are organized into categories, making it easy to find and generate the data you need. Below is an overview of the available report categories and the specific reports they contain.

## Activity reports

Activity reports provide detailed insights into the movements and stops of your vehicles, allowing you to monitor trip histories and identify patterns in vehicle usage.

* **Trips**\
  This report offers a detailed history of trips, including length, travel time, stop duration, and speed. It also provides an overview of fuel consumption for vehicles without fuel sensors.
* **Stops**\
  The Stops report breaks down the details of stops and parkings, including location, duration, and idle time (time spent with the engine on while parked).
* **Trips and Stops by Shifts**\
  A combined report that allows you to view trip and stop data segmented by shifts, helping you analyze vehicle use during specific time intervals.

## Landmarks reports

Landmarks reports help you track visits to predefined geographic areas, such as geofences and points of interest (POIs).

* **Geofence Visits**\
  Tracks the number of visits to geofenced areas over a specified period, providing details on entries, exits, and the duration of stays.
* **POI Visits**\
  Similar to the geofence report, this tracks visits to points of interest, detailing the date and time of each visit.

## Safety and security reports

These reports focus on safety-related events and alerts generated by the system, helping you ensure the security of your vehicles and drivers.

* **Car Security**\
  Provides details on car alarms, evacuations, crashes, and other security events.

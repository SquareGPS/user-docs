### Schedule

{% columns %}
{% column %}
**Turn on/off** _(_&#x69;n **General settings**_)_**.** You can configure tracking according to a schedule. For example, specify only business hours. The rest of the time, the location will not be tracked, new tasks will not be downloaded, and no new messages will be received in the chat.

**Time for activation.** Choose the start and end time for tracking.

**Days for activation.** Choose which days to enable tracking, according to the "Days for activation" settings.

If tracking is enabled according to the schedule, you can turn it off at any time. It will turn on again automatically in the next time period according to the schedule.

### Advanced settings

{% columns %}
{% column %}
**Device identifier.** Here you can specify a different device ID. For example, if you deleted the old one and created a new one, but want to continue to use the same phone as a tracker.

**Offline mode.** Allows sending forms/photos in **Check-ins** and **Tasks** without a network.

**Tasks sync time span.** Determines how many tasks will be downloaded in advance. You can reduce this value to not load too many tasks at once.

**Compress images.** If your SIM card has very expensive or limited Internet traffic, you can enable this feature. All photos sent in forms or check-ins will be compressed. Image quality will be reduced, but the application will use less traffic.

**Notifications.** Will open the phone notification settings for the X-GPS Tracker application. The appearance of the menu and the available functionality may vary depending on the phone model.

**Widget control.** You can add the widget of the **X-GPS Tracker** application to the desktop of your phone. This setting allows you to start tracking with one tap on the widget, without having to launch the application.

**Fix timezone offset**. Use if necessary. Usually required if the phone has a time zone that does not match its location.

**External navigation.** Choose which app will be open to show directions to the **Task** location.

**Connection settings.** Using this menu, you can manually set the IP address and port of the server. Standard server:

* Server address: **52.57.1.136** or **13.52.37.2** (depending on the region)
* Server port: **47770**

**Technical info.** Shows how many points are currently recorded in the device's memory.

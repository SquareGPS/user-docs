# Places

In the "Places" section, you will see a list of places for which the employee using the X-GPS Tracker application has been assigned.

For a POI to be displayed in this section, the following conditions must match:

- The place must have a [custom field](https://www.navixy.com/docs/user/web-interface-docs/user-account/custom-fields/?simple-theme-css=simple&cacsp_bypass=true) "Employee"
- This field must have the "Assignee" parameter enabled
- Current employee must be specified in this field.
- The tracker must be linked to the employee in the "Staff" section

The list shows the icon, name, address and distance to the place. Also, in the list you can search and sort available places (alphabetically and by distance).

The list of available POIs is updated every time an employee opens this section, or when he enables tracking.

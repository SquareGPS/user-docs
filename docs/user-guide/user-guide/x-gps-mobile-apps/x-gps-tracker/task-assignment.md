# Task assignment

This feature simplifies work and communication with your employees. Now you can remotely assign tasks to your employees.

The application will automatically notify the employee about adding new and changing existing tasks. For example, if you suddenly change the delivery address, you don’t have to call the courier, you can just update the task on the platform and the information will be instantly sent to the employee’s phone. At the same time, the employee will know for sure that his working status is visible on the platform, and the arrival time will be recorded automatically.

### Push-notifications about new tasks and changing task’s status

When a manager assigns a new task or edits an already assigned one, a remote employee receives a push-notification on the smartphone or tablet.

The system also notifies the employee’s arrival to the task place and the process status, e.g. “accomplished”, “failed” or “overdue”. The notifications are accompanied by a sound signal or vibration.

### Sorting by distance, time, and status

It is also possible to sort the list of tasks alphabetically, by time, or by distance from the performer. You should just choose the desired feature in the settings.

# Assets list

This screen displays all your assets: vehicles, staff, and objects (unassigned GPS devices). To view more information about any of your assets, simply tap its entry. To find a specific asset, tap ![Search](attachments/icon2.png)

 and enter its name.

The icon to the right of each asset indicates its movement status, such as moving or parked.

### Events

Tap ![Bell](attachments/icon1.png)

 to view the events.

This screen shows various events occurring to your assets, such as leaving or entering a geofence, going idle, speeding, completing tasks, and more. To filter by category type, tap **All**, **Vehicles**, **Staff**, or **Objects**.

The second menu shows your current filters, all of which can be configured: time period, specific vehicles or staff, and event types. The **Unread** filter will display only the unread notifications, while **Emergency** will narrow down your search to urgent events.

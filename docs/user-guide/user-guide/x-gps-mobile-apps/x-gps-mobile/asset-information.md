### Events

Tap **Events** to view the asset’s event history, such as leaving or entering a geofence, going idle, speeding, completing tasks, crashing, deviating from the route, arriving at a checkpoint, and more.

The menu below the asset’s name shows your current filters, all of which can be configured: time period, specific vehicles or staff, and event types. The **Unread** filter will display only unread notifications, while **Emergency** will narrow down your search to urgent events.

Tap an event to display its details. You can also tap the map on top of the screen to view it in fullscreen. The ![icon5.png](attachments/72b55e8f-c207-46df-bb7b-df4900c1db13)

All the information about vehicles of your organization is in **Fleet management**.

It makes your work easier and much more convenient. For example, you enter data on fuel consumption per 100 km (or miles), and monitoring system will calculate fuel consumption based on this indicator to compare it with the actual readings.

### Vehicles

The **Vehicles** tab displays information about the user's vehicles as a table and an additional visualized menu on the right side of the screen.

In this tab it is possible to add and edit vehicles, attach them to the depots and link them to trackers activated on the platform.

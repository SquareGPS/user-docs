# Device switched ON/OFF

## Overview

The "Device switched ON/OFF" rule allows users to monitor when a GPS device is powered on or off. This rule is particularly helpful for managers who need to ensure that employees are using GPS devices according to prescribed policies during work hours. It provides valuable insights into device usage patterns, helping to prevent device misuse and ensuring that the devices are functioning properly.

> [!WARNING]
> This rule applies only to devices that have the capability to report their power status. In other words, the GPS device must be able to send notifications to the platform when it is powered on or off. If a device lacks this functionality, the rule cannot be applied, as the platform would not receive the necessary data to trigger notifications, but you can still use the device independent “[Device lost connection](../device-connection/device-lost-connection.md)” rule.

## Rule settings

### Tracker switched ON

The "Tracker switched ON" rule triggers a notification when a tracker is powered on, provided the device has the necessary reporting functionality.

**Key Points:**

- **Purpose:** Monitors when a tracker is powered on, helping you keep track of when devices return to operation.
- **Reset Timer:** The "Tracker switched ON" alert includes a 60-second reset timer, which prevents multiple alerts from being sent within a single minute, reducing unnecessary notifications.
- **Configuration:** The rule requires minimal setup and supports multiple trackers as long as they have the capability to report power-on events.

### Tracker switched ON/OFF

The "Tracker switched OFF" rule triggers a notification when a tracker is powered off or loses connection, provided the device can report this event and triggers again when back on.

**Key Points:**

- **Purpose:** Notifies you when a tracker is turned off or loses its connection, allowing you to respond to potential issues quickly.
- **Reset Timer:** This alert includes a 10-second reset timer, ensuring that alerts are not triggered more frequently than once every 10 seconds, preventing excessive notifications.
- **Configuration:** Similar to the "Tracker switched ON" rule, this rule also requires minimal configuration and can be applied to multiple trackers that support power-off event reporting.

For common settings, please refer to [Rules and Notifications](../../rules-and-notifications.md).

## System operation details

- The "Tracker switched ON/OFF" rule operates based on the hardware events generated by the tracker when it is turned on or off. These events are transmitted to the platform and processed for notification.
- The rule is flexible and can be applied to multiple trackers simultaneously, provided they support the ON/OFF event feature.
- If the platform identifies a hardware event of this type without valid coordinates, the event is still counted as valid and displayed, ensuring that no crucial events are missed.
- The system allows you to track these events regardless of whether they occur inside or outside defined geofences, as the geofence logic is bypassed for these specific events to ensure comprehensive monitoring.

This rule is instrumental in maintaining the operational integrity of your fleet, ensuring that all trackers are functioning as expected, and enabling quick responses to any unexpected changes in tracker status.

# Sign up

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to sign up for a user account.

## Asking your Service Provider

We recommend reaching out to your [GPS / Telematics service provider](service-provider.md) as they can help you create your account with all related information.

## Signing up from the Platform

1. **Access the login page**  
Navigate to the login page of the user web interface using any desktop or mobile browser. The address of the login page depends on your [GPS / Telematics service provider](service-provider.md), so please consult with them for the correct URL.
2. **Choose a Login and Password**  
To begin, complete the registration form by providing the necessary information, including a password and an active email address that will be used as your login to access the platform.
  - Enter a valid email address
  - Create a strong password
3. **Confirming the registration**  
After completing the registration, you will receive an email with a confirmation link. Follow this link to verify your email address and activate your account.

## FAQs and Troubleshooting

- **Can't find the registration link**  
If the registration link is not available on the welcome page, it may be because your Service Provider has disabled the option for self-registration. Please contact your service provider to get an account.
- **Confirmation link was not received**  
You need to provide a valid email address. Your account will remain inactive until you confirm your registration by following the link sent to your email. The message may also have ended up in your spam folder.
- **Forgot password**  
If you forget your password, you can easily recover it using the [Forgot password](../account/password-recovery.md) option on the login page.

If you're still having trouble signing up, please contact the support team of [your service provider](service-provider.md).

# User administration

The users of the organization’s account include the **owner** and the **users**. The owner is the main account holder with full control and administrative rights, while users are additional accounts with specific roles and permissions assigned by the owner.

## Owner and users

The owner in Navixy is the main account holder with full access and control over the platform. This account has the highest level of permissions and can perform all administrative tasks. The owner has exclusive rights that cannot be transferred to other accounts, ensuring they maintain ultimate control over the account.

The owner can limit the operations available to users by:

* [Defining user roles](role-management.md), specifying what actions users can perform
* [Limiting user access to information](restricting-access.md), controlling which GPS devices and data users can access

Users are additional accounts granted access by the owner. As a subordinate account, a user cannot have specific owner rights, including:

* Creating, editing, or removing other users
* Editing GPS devices, geofences, or Places that are not accessible to them
* Limiting the owner’s access to their account

### **Viewing and editing the user list**

To add a new user or edit the list of users, navigate to **Account Settings** → Users **and Roles** in the main menu.

## Owner and users

The Owner in Navixy is the main account holder with full access and control over the platform. This account has the highest level of permissions and can perform all administrative tasks. The Owner has exclusive rights that cannot be transferred to other accounts, ensuring they maintain ultimate control over the account.

The owner can limit the operations available to users by:

* [Defining user roles](role-management.md) — specifying what actions users can perform;
* [Limiting user access to information](restrict-access.md) — controlling which GPS devices and data users can access.

Users are additional accounts granted access by the Owner. As a subordinate accounts, users cannot have specific owner rights, including:

* Creating, editing, or removing other users
* Editing GPS devices, Geofences or Places that are not accessible to them
* Limiting the Owner’s access to their account

# Activity log

Using the **Activity log**, the account owner can track the activity of all [users on the team](users-and-roles/) added via **Users and roles**. This feature provides detailed insights into user actions, helping to monitor and manage system usage effectively.

Navigate to **Account settings → Activity log**.

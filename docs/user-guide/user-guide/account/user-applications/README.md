# User applications

## Overview

This feature empowers you to extend and customize your platform's functionality by seamlessly integrating third-party tools and custom add-ons. Applications are building blocks that let you create a personalized workspace where all your essential tools are just a click away. Whether you need to analyze complex data, streamline communication, or integrate specialized industry tools, this functionality makes it possible without requiring technical expertise.

You choose how external tools integrate with your workspace. Some applications work best when embedded directly into the interface, becoming part of your daily workflow. Others may benefit from opening in new tabs, giving you the full-screen experience when needed. The system adapts to your preferences while maintaining security and ease of use through features like URL parameters, user identification, and secure session management.

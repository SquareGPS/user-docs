# Managing existing User applications

Account **Owners** have full administrative control over applications, while **Users** have limited access based on enabled applications. Here's a detailed breakdown of permissions:

| **Permission/Action**                    | **Owner** | **User** |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- |

| Edit existing applications               | ✓         | ✗        |
| Delete applications                      | ✓         | ✗        |
| Enable/disable applications              | ✓         | ✗        |
| View enabled applications in the sidebar | ✓         | ✓        |
| Use enabled applications                 | ✓         | ✓        |

## Working with existing applications

Further descriptions cover the operations available exclusively to account **Owners**.

### Editing

The editing interface provides full access to all settings available during the initial application creation. To modify an existing application:

1. Navigate to the **User applications** list in your account section.
2. Click **Edit** next to the desired application.
3. Modify settings as needed (all original creation options are available).
4. Save your changes when complete. The platform will prompt you to save any unsaved changes before leaving the editing interface.

{% hint style="info" %}
Changes take effect immediately and are visible to all users with access to the application.
{% endhint %}

### Switching visibility

Application display can be managed using the enable/disable switch in the **User application** interface. When an application is:

* **Enabled** – It appears in all users' sidebars and can be used by them.
* **Disabled** – It remains in the application list but is hidden from the sidebar.

All application settings are preserved when disabled and can be restored by re-enabling.

### Removing applications

Applications can be permanently deleted from an account:

1. Locate the application in the **User applications** list
2. Click **Remove** next to the desired application. You will be asked for confirmation of this action.
3. Once confirmed, the application is permanently deleted from both the sidebar and the **User applications** list.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Removed applications cannot be recovered.
{% endhint %}

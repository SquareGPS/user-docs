# Solution connectors

Every day businesses struggle with disconnected hardware and software tools that don't work together. In the telematics industry, this fragmentation makes it difficult to collect and analyze data effectively.

Understanding these challenges, Navixy is building a connected ecosystem by integrating with modern telematics solutions across the industry. As the market evolves, we're extending our approach beyond individual devices to include entire applications where these devices are already supported.

By integrating with 3rd-party solutions, we're creating a more unified telematics experience that gives businesses efficient access to comprehensive capabilities without the complexity of managing multiple disconnected systems.

# Map tools

The **Tracking** module contains tools and options in the top-right and bottom-right corners of the map. These tools allow you to easily view or change your map, layers, geofences, and POIs.

## Map search

The **Search** tool contains the following options that help you find specific locations:

* **Address search**: Enter an address to locate it on the map.
* **Places by label and tag**: Search for places using predefined labels and tags.
* **Geofences by label and tag**: Find geofences using their labels and tags.

## Places (POIs)

Places, also known as Points of Interest (POI), are specific locations that help organizations track visits, optimize route planning, and streamline various activities by marking key locations like offices, warehouses, and other critical sites.

## Geofences

Geofences are virtual perimeters that allow the system to monitor whether an object has crossed the geofence border ("in" or "out"). They enable users to generate geofence reports, receive alerts, and apply specific rules for events within designated areas.

## Map layers

You can choose different map layers to suit your needs. Options range from standard street maps to satellite imagery provided by various map vendors and may depend on the subscription plan. You can also [add map overlays using custom layers](https://squaregps.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/USERDOCSOLD/pages/2909014434/Layers?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNWNhZTE4MDg2NDA1NDNkZmI1NGEyYTE0OGM3MDA5NzQiLCJwIjoiYyJ9).

## Map

You can choose a different map, such as **Google Maps** or **OpenStreetMap**. You also have the option to add your own map, such as **Mapbox** or **LocationIQ**.

## Street view

Access **Street View** by right-clicking on the map. This feature allows you to view real-world imagery of locations for better context and navigation.

## Route

The **Route** tool helps in planning and visualizing the path between multiple points. You can create and view detailed routes, making it easier to plan logistics.

## Distance and area measuring

The **Measuring** tool allows you to calculate:

* **Distance**: Measure the distance between two or more points on the map.
* **Area**: Calculate the area within a specified boundary.

## Reference point

The **Reference point** tool lets you mark a point on the map for easy reference. This can be useful for pinpointing key locations or setting up navigation aids, including sorting objects in your list by distance from the reference point.

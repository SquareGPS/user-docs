# Forms

**Forms** are electronic documents that can be attached to tasks, allowing employees to submit task results directly through the [X-GPS Tracker](../x-gps-mobile-apps/x-gps-tracker/) mobile app. These forms can include various types of fields such as text fields for client orders, inspection reports, and media sections for uploading photos and videos.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Save the form
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Two toggles are available when creating a form:

* **Use by default when creating a task**: If enabled, this form will be attached to new tasks by default unless another form is selected. In the form list, this form will be marked with a star.
* **Submit form only in the zone**: If enabled, the form can only be submitted when the employee is within a predefined geographic zone, ensuring that task reporting occurs at the correct location.

After saving, the created forms can be accessed through the form list.

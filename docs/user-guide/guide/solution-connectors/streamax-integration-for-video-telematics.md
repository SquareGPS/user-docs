# Streamax

Streamax is a leading MDVR manufacturer, well-proven in the global market. With their devices, you can enable 24/7 video recording from your vehicles, collect telematics data, remotely access video footage, and monitor driving safety using ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) and DSM (Driver Status Monitoring) technologies.

By integrating Streamax with Navixy, you get comprehensive video monitoring combined with advanced fleet management in a single interface. Let's take a closer look at how to implement this powerful combination and embed Streamax daashboard into Navixy interface.

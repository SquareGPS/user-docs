# Speed violation report

The **Speed violation** **report** detects and lists every episode where a vehicle exceeded a speed threshold you define. You set the permitted speed and the minimum duration an episode must last to be included, and the report finds all matching intervals in the data.

Unlike alerts, which notify you in real time, the **Speed violation** **report** is a retrospective analysis tool. It works by scanning the recorded track data for consecutive data points above the threshold, which means it can catch episodes that may have been missed by rules or notifications.

### Speed violation report use cases

* **Policy enforcement**: check whether drivers stayed within a company-wide or route-specific speed limit across an entire day, week, or month.
* **Risk assessment**: identify the most frequent or severe speeding episodes to focus safety training on the right drivers or routes.
* **Driver comparison**: Enable **Group by drivers** to see which driver had the most or the longest violations during their assigned periods.
* **Incident investigation**: after an accident or a customer complaint, look up the specific violation — its time, duration, peak speed, and the address where the peak occurred.
* **Minimum duration filtering**: Filter out brief speed spikes (e.g., GPS noise or momentary overtaking) by requiring a minimum violation duration, so only sustained overspeed is reported.

### Speed violation report parameters

* **Hide empty tabs:** When enabled, tabs for devices (or drivers) with no violations are omitted from the report entirely instead of showing a "no violations found" message.
* **Show seconds:** Controls whether durations appear as `hh:mm:ss` or `hh:mm`.
* **Violation duration (required)**: the minimum time in minutes a speeding episode must last to appear in the report. Episodes shorter than this are silently discarded. Set to 0 to include even the briefest spikes. Valid range: 0–1440 (24 hours).
* **Permitted speed (required)**: the speed limit in km/h (or mph, depending on your measurement system). Any continuous period above this value is detected as a violation. Valid range: 1–400.
* **Group by driver:** when enabled, the report is organized into separate sections per driver based on driver assignment history. If a driver was not assigned during part of the period, those intervals are attributed to an unidentified driver.
* **Use smart filter:** Excludes short or invalid trips from the report. A regular trip is excluded if it has fewer than 3 data points, covers less than 100 meters, or stays within a 200-meter diameter. Additionally, individual track points with suspicious mileage patterns (e.g. implausibly high or low speeds) are removed.

### How to read the Speed violation report

#### Speed graph

Each device tab starts with a time-series graph covering the entire report period. It plots two overlays:

* Speed (blue line): the vehicle's speed over time.
* Mileage (green area): cumulative distance traveled over the same period.

A horizontal red marker line is drawn at the permitted speed threshold, so you can visually see where and for how long the speed line exceeds the limit.

The graph's time axis uses the user's timezone. Gaps of more than 30 minutes between data points are treated as breaks in the graph rather than connected as a single line.

#### Speedv violations table

Below the graph, a table lists every detected violation, grouped by day. A separator row before each day shows the date and the number of violations on that day. The table title also displays the configured threshold and minimum duration — for example: _"Speed violations (above 60 km/h with duration of 5+ min.)"_.

Columns:

* **Start time**: when the vehicle first exceeded the permitted speed.
* **Duration**: how long the violation lasted (from the first over-threshold point to the first at-or-below-threshold point, or to a gap of 30+ minutes).
* **Average speed**: the average speed during the violation. Calculated from the distance covered and duration of the episode.
* **Max speed**: the highest recorded speed during the violation.
* **Address**: the location where the peak speed was recorded (resolved to a street address).

### Important notes

* This report has no **Summary** tab. Each device (or each driver section, when grouping by drivers) gets its own tab, with no cross-device aggregate.
* Speed values from the tracker are always stored internally in km/h. The permitted speed you enter and all displayed values are converted to your measurement system (km/h or mph) automatically.
* A violation ends when the speed drops to or below the permitted speed, or when there is a gap of more than 30 minutes between data points. These two conditions are checked separately — a 30-minute gap always ends the current violation even if the next point is still above the threshold.
* The minimum duration filter uses a strictly-greater-than comparison: an episode lasting exactly the minimum duration is excluded; it must be at least one second longer to be included.

# Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of an IoT Logic flow. Each node handles a specific stage of the data lifecycle, from receiving raw device telemetry to forwarding enriched data to its destination. Every flow requires at minimum one input node and one output node. This page is a reference overview of all available node types, follow the links in the table for full configuration details.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Device action** and **Webhook** are terminal nodes, they perform an action when triggered but do not pass data forward, so no outgoing connections can be added after them. If you place a terminal node on a conditional branch of an **IF/THEN Logic** node, connect the Logic node directly to an **Output Endpoint** node in parallel to ensure data continues flowing through the other branch.

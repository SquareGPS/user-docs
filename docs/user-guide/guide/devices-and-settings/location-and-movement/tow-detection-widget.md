# Tow detection widget

The **Tow detection feature**, available in many vehicle GPS devices, is designed to detect unauthorized movement based on signals from the built-in motion sensor. Once the vehicle's ignition is switched off, the sensor enters active mode, continuously monitoring for vibrations, impacts, or movement. If any of these are detected, a notification is immediately sent to the platform from the device and can be reported to the user as configured in [Rules and notifications](../../events-and-notifications/security/unauthorized-movement.md).

In Navixy, you can configure this function by accessing the **Tow detection** **widget** in the **Devices and settings** module. This panel allows you to adjust the motion sensor sensitivity and specify the time delay before detection begins.

# Remote download settings

Configures automatic, scheduled tachograph downloads on devices that support remote download. It stores the company card number and how often the vehicle unit and driver card data are collected.

## Settings

* **Company card number**: the identifier on the company's tachograph card, used by the device to authenticate remote download requests. Enter the number exactly as it appears on the card.
* **Vehicle unit download interval** (days): how often the device's on-board tachograph unit data is pulled automatically. EU regulations require a vehicle unit download at least every 90 days; many operators use 28 days as a standard interval.
* **Driver card download interval** (days): how often driver card data is downloaded automatically when a card is present in the tachograph. EU regulations require driver card data at least every 28 days.

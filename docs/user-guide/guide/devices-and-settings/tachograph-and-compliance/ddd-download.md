# DDD download

## Purpose

The **DDD files download** block lets you **remotely request tachograph data** from a vehicle as DDD files, without physically connecting to the tachograph. What you can request depends on the device family — from a single **Download** button on simple devices to detailed, multi-type, date-ranged requests on richer ones.

{% hint style="info" %}
The download controls are **on-demand commands**, not saved settings. Clicking a download button sends a request to the device; it does not store a configuration.
{% endhint %}

<!-- SCREENSHOT: DDD files download block (Teltonika variant) showing data-type options, card 1/2, and date range. Annotate: data type, card selection, activities date range, send button. -->

## Initial setup

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Unload data from the company or driver card**

Connect a card reader to your computer and use it to unload data from the company or driver card.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Enter the company card number**

In the **DDD files download** block, enter the company card number (an internal document of the organization) where prompted, then save. This associates downloaded files with your company. The TachoAuthClient application may be required for downloading; contact Navixy technical support to obtain it.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Download options by device family

What appears in the block depends on the device:

* **Simple devices** — a single **Download** button retrieves the available data.
* **Teltonika** — choose a **data type**: **card 1 / card 2**, **driver activities** (with a **date range**, up to about 90 days), **detailed speed**, **events & faults**, **technical data**, or **overview**. You can also store a **company card number**.
* **Galileo / BCE** — a download command (BCE also exposes slot 1 / slot 2 and vehicle-unit activities).
* **Remote-download variants** — store a **company-card number** and set **auto-download intervals** for the vehicle unit and the driver card, so data is collected automatically on a schedule.

## Downloading

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
**Request the download**

Click the **Download** button (or send the relevant data-type command) for the data you need. The download can take several minutes — typically 5 to 10.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Keep the ignition on**

Ensure the vehicle's ignition is on during the download. If the ignition is off, the download fails and you must restart it.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

Once a download completes, the file can be emailed automatically to the recipients you configure — see [DDD emails](ddd-emails.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Navixy only supports the **download functionality** of DDD files. We do not process them in any way and do not read any data from them. DDD download and retention are legally regulated — in the EU, driver-card data is typically downloaded about monthly and vehicle-unit data about quarterly, with roughly one year of retention.

# No movement

Reports when a device that is expected to be moving stays stationary longer than a set threshold. Useful for monitoring vehicles on active routes — for example, detecting a delivery vehicle that has stopped longer than expected.

{% hint style="info" %}
Unlike [Unauthorized movement](unauthorized-movement.md), which watches a **parked** vehicle for unexpected movement, No movement watches a vehicle expected to be **moving** for unexpected stillness.
{% endhint %}

## Settings

* **Enable**: turn no-movement detection on or off.
* **Timeout**: how long the device may remain stationary before an event is sent to the Navixy platform. Set this to match the longest acceptable stop for the vehicle's task — for example, 30 minutes for a delivery route.
* **Pre-alarm duration**: an optional warning period that fires before the main no-movement event. Use it to trigger an early notification before the full alert, giving the driver time to respond.

## Availability

Appears on device models that support no-movement detection.

# Fuel consumption calculation

Sets the parameters the device uses to compute fuel consumption itself. This is separate from platform-side [fuel sensors](../../vehicle-sensors/measurement-sensors/).

## Settings

* **Fuel type**: gasoline, diesel, or LPG. Affects the consumption coefficients used in the estimate.
* **Engine volume**: the engine displacement in liters (for example, `2.0` for a 2-liter engine).
* **Multiplier**: a correction factor applied to the estimated result. Use `1.0` for no correction. Set it below `1.0` if the device overestimates consumption, or above `1.0` if it underestimates.

## Availability

Appears on device models that compute fuel consumption on the device side.

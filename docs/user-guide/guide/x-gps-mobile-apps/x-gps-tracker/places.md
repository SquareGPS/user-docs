# Places

In the **Places** section, you will see a list of places assigned to the employee who uses **X-GPS Tracker**.

For a POI to be displayed in this section, the following conditions must be met:

* The place must have a [custom field](../../account/custom-fields.md) called "Employee"
* This field must have the **Assignee** parameter enabled
* The current employee must be specified in this field
* The tracker must be linked to the employee in the **Staff** section

The list shows the icon, name, address, and distance to the place. You can also search and sort the available places alphabetically and by distance.

The list of available POIs is updated every time an employee opens this section or when tracking is enabled.

* To get detailed information about a place, just tap it.
* This will open a new window with the location on the map and a complete list of all fields, standard and custom.
* To see all the fields, just swipe up.
* Tapping the button to the right of the address automatically opens an external navigation application and calculates the optimal route.
* Fields with e-mail address and phone number are tappable. Tapping them will allow you to instantly make a call or start writing a message.

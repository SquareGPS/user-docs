# First launch

### Tracker ID

At the first launch, the application will ask you to enter the **device ID**. You can find it in the invitation received in the SMS message or e-mail.

Please note that this step will be skipped if you started the application by following the link from the invitation. In this case, the ID will be configured automatically.

If you lost or deleted the invitation, you can find the ID in the web interface in a special widget.

After tapping the **How-to guide** button, the application will detect the manufacturer and model of the phone and provide recommendations. We recommend that you carefully read all the points and perform the proposed actions.

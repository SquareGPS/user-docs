# Check-ins

The **Check-in** feature allows you to fix your location on the map, attach up to 9 photos, and add a comment.

{% hint style="info" %}
_Field employees using X-GPS Tracker can report on visiting checkpoints, report on work performed, and transmit more detailed information on various events._
{% endhint %}

### Sending a mark

To send a mark:

1. Open the **X-GPS Tracker** app
2. On the **Map** tab and tap **Check in**
3. In the opened window, add a photo and a comment
4. Tap the **Check-in** button to send a message to the monitoring system

After that, the information contained in the check-in mark will be transmitted to the server.

You'll receive the following information about each mark:

* Notifications in the web interface
* Push notifications in the mobile app

### Forms in Check-ins

You can also attach and fill out a [form](../../field-service/forms.md) before submitting the Check-in. This feature can be useful, for example, in cases when an employee performs an emergency unplanned task and the operator has not yet entered it into the system.

The process is identical to [performing tasks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaHJU_EEkUU) in the **X-GPS tracker** application. However, there are a couple of things to consider when using this feature:

* Filling out the form is always optional to submit the Check-in.
* The form, like the Check-in itself, can be sent only if tracking is enabled and a connection to the server is established.
* The form can only be submitted at the same time as the checkout. Before submitting, you can edit the form without restrictions. After submitting, you can no longer edit the form.

Completed forms can be found in the **Field service** -> **Forms** -> \[select the required form] -> **Submissions**. See [Viewing completed forms](../../field-service/forms.md#viewing-completed-forms) for more information.

6. Add the exported file and specify the default radius for circle geofences.

For polygon geofences, the import will be done exactly as in the Wialon system. For circle geofences, the centers with radiuses specified in the previous step will be transferred. After that, you might need to change the radius of geofences manually. Place the cursor on the required geofence and press the pencil button that appears.

After transferring geofences, they can be used for rules and analytics on the Navixy platform.

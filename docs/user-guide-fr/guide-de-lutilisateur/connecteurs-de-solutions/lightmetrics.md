# Lightmetrics

Lightmetrics is a leading provider of AI-powered video telematics solutions, specializing in edge AI technology and no-code platform deployment. Their flagship RideView platform is designed specifically for telematics service providers (TSPs) and OEMs, enabling deployment of advanced video telematics in just 3 weeks. With hardware-agnostic capabilities, RideView works across multiple dash camera types, including exclusive access to Suntech ST9730 and support for the popular Jimi JC450, while delivering efficient edge AI for real-time driver coaching and fleet safety management.

By integrating Lightmetrics with Navixy, you get intelligent video analytics with edge AI processing combined with fleet management in a single interface. Let's examine how to implement this combination and embed the Lightmetrics dashboard into your Navixy interface.

#### **Establishing integration**

To establish the integration, you'll need to set up your Lightmetrics Master account and configure proper account matching between your Lightmetrics and Navixy systems.

**Request Master account creation (one-time setup)**

1. **Contact Navixy**: Send a request to your Customer Success Manager or use [this form](https://www.navixy.com/contact/) to request Lightmetrics Master account creation.
2. **Wait for confirmation**: Our specialists will coordinate with Lightmetrics to create an account for you. You will receive credentials to log into your Lightmetrics account.

{% hint style="success" %}
After completing these steps, your Lightmetrics Master account is ready for integration with Navixy. You can now proceed to device activation and UI embedding for each customer account you've configured.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### **Adding devices to Navixy**

Since Lightmetrics is device-agnostic, you can add any compatible devices to the platform following the standard device activation procedure. The only requirement is that the device should already exist in your Lightmetrics account.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that your device is properly configured in your Lightmetrics account before proceeding with the activation in Navixy.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to **Device activation**.
2. Select your device from the list.
3. Select **SIM card purchased separately** option and go to the next step.
4. Enter a correct **Device ID** (device IMEI).
5. Complete the device configuration.

Your device and Navixy account are ready for the integration!
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

#### **Embedding Lightmetrics in Navixy UI**

**Create API key**

Before embedding, you need to create an API key for this integration in your Navixy account.

1. In Navixy, go to **Account settings** â†’ **API keys**.
2. Click <img src="https://2096203889-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F446mKak1zDrGv70ahuYZ%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-8162eb61f85ccbbb68c97e0a17a48eef5e8b574b%2Fimage-20250422-143344.png?alt=media" alt="" data-size="line"> to add a new key.
3. In the **Label** field, enter:\
   `Lightmetrics FleetID = [ID]`\
   \
   Replace **\[ID]** with the actual Fleet ID from Lightmetrics fleet. For example:\
   ![](https://2096203889-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F446mKak1zDrGv70ahuYZ%2Fuploads%2FH3TAUMSNfef8y03pvzig%2Fimage.png?alt=media\&token=7404dc3e-4cd5-431d-8b5e-bae16ea4cf7d)
4. Click **Save** and keep this key available for the next step.

**Create new User aplication**

At this step, we perform the actual integration by embedding the Lightmetrics dashboard into your Navixy interface.\
Navixy offers User applications functionality that allows embedding 3rd-party apps directly in the platform's interface. We will use it to embed Lightmetrics.

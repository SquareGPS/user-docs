# Identify a usual / longest parking location via API

### Question

Can we identify which place is the longest parking location for each device through API?

### Answer

There is no dedicated endpoint for “usual parking location”.

However, you can determine it using trip data from the API.

Approach 1:

* Call `track/list` for a period (for example a month).
* Compute gaps between one trip’s `end_time` and the next trip’s `start_time`.
* Use the previous trip end location as the parking point.
* The location with the longest gap is a likely main parking spot.

Approach 2:

* Take the last trip end location each day.
* The most frequent location is likely the usual parking spot.

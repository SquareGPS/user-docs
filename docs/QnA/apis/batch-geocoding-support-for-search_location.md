# Batch geocoding support for search\_location

### Question

Does `geocoder/search_location` support batch coordinate geocoding?

### Answer

No.

Geocoders typically handle one coordinate pair per request.

If you need to process multiple coordinates, do it in your code:

* loop through the coordinate list in your code
* call `search_location` per coordinate
* collect results

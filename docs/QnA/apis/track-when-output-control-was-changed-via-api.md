# Track when output control was changed via API

### Question

Can we get the last updated time of output control through the API?

### Answer

Two options depending on what you need:

1.  **Platform/API change history**

    Use `user/audit/log/list`.

    Filter by output control actions.
2.  **Actual output state change**

    Create an output state change alert.

    Then read notifications via history endpoints.

Summary:

* Use audit logs to track platform/API actions for output control.
* Use events if you want to know when output state physically changed, regardless of how it was triggered.

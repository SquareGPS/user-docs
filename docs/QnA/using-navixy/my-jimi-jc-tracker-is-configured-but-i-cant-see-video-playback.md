# My Jimi JC tracker is configured but I can't see video playback

### Question

Why can’t I see video playback from my Jimi JC tracker?

### Answer

If your JC-series tracker (like the JC261) is connected but you’re not seeing any video playback, it’s likely because the device hasn’t been told to upload recorded videos yet. No worries — this is easy to fix.

To make videos visible on the platform, just send these three commands to your tracker (in this exact order) via SMS or AirConsole:

* `COREKITSW,0#` Enables video uploads to the platform.
* `FILELIST,http://{server}:7514/filelist` Lets the device send a list of videos stored on the SD card. These show up in gray on the calendar and timeline.
* `UPLOAD,http://{server}/upload` Tells the tracker to actually upload selected videos. These will appear in blue and stay available for 30 days.

Replace {server} with the IP address of your platform:

* US: 13.52.37.2
* EU: 52.57.1.136

And don’t forget to replace with your device’s IMEI number.

**Example:** For a tracker with IMEI 88887777 connected to the US server, the commands would be:

```
COREKITSW,0# FILELIST,http://13.52.37.2:7514/filelist/88887777 
UPLOAD,http://13.52.37.2/upload/88887777
```

Make sure your tracker is online to receive these commands over GPRS. If it’s offline, SMS will work too — as long as the SIM supports it.

# How to troubleshoot Jimi JC400 video streaming and playback

### Question

How to set up and troubleshoot Jimi JC400 video streaming and playback?

### Answer

Follow these steps in order:

1.  Verify IMEI is correct.

    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (145)>)
2.  Verify SIM supports SMS and has working GPRS/LTE.

    Make sure:

    * the device can receive SMS (if you plan to configure via SMS)
    * GPRS/LTE traffic service is available
    * GSM coverage is sufficient for RTMP traffic

    <div data-gb-custom-block data-tag="hint" data-style="info" class="hint hint-info"><p>SMS service is often not available on M2M SIM cards.</p></div>
3.  Check firmware with `VERSION`.

    Supported examples:

    * JC400 (JC400A): `[VERSION]KMC28_JC400_WABA_STD_V4.3.2_220328.1750,[BUILD]2022-03-28 14:50`
    * JC400D: `[VERSION]JC400D_WAVA_DMS_V4.2.13_210716.2013_BUILD_2021-07-16`
4. If firmware is old, update via SD card `update.zip`.
   * [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y56Tk5Xv3KGh-7J6XPdzs6tQUKqEglca/view?usp=sharing) and copy `update.zip` to the device SD card (don’t unpack it).
   * Insert SD card into the device and power it on.
   * The device updates firmware automatically.
5.  Configure timezone UTC+0 and APN + server settings.

    EU server IP: `52.57.1.136`

    US server IP: `13.52.37.2`

    Send commands one by one.

    Substitute `{apn}`, `{apn_user}`, `{apn_pass}` (without braces).

    EU:

    ```
    COREKITSW,0#
    SERVER,0,52.57.1.136,47755#
    APN,{apn},{apn},,,,,,{apn_user},,{apn_pass},,,,#
    ```

    US / Latin America:

    ```
    COREKITSW,0#
    SERVER,0,13.52.37.2,47755#
    APN,{apn},{apn},,,,,,{apn_user},,{apn_pass},,,,#
    ```

    If APN user/pass must be blank, leave fields empty:

    ```
    APN,{apn},{apn},,,,,,,,,,,,,#
    ```
6.  Retry activation in UI when online.

    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (146)>)
7. If the device is offline unexpectedly, verify it is powered on and has sufficient battery charge.

### If default commands are disabled

If “send default settings” is disabled in Admin Panel, or activation retry doesn’t push settings, send the following commands one by one.

Substitute `{IMEI}` with your device IMEI (no braces).

EU:

```

# LBS Signals and False Geofence Events

### Question

Are LBS signals taken into account when generating geofence entry and exit events, and can they cause false positives in geofence reports?

### Answer

Yes. LBS-based positions can be used by the platform, and they can cause false positives in geofence reporting.

This usually happens when:

* the tracker cannot provide reliable GPS/GNSS (indoors, weak signal, etc.)
* the tracker sends an LBS position with a large radius
* the LBS radius overlaps a geofence boundary

If the radius overlaps the geofence, the platform can interpret it as an exit and later an entry.

#### How to reduce false positives

Check the device’s GSM/LBS data quality first.

Then adjust **LBS detection radius** in device settings so the LBS radius remains within the expected area.

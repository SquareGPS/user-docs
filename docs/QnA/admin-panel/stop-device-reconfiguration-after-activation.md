# Stop device reconfiguration after activation

## Question

I configured my device before connecting it. After activation, settings changed. How do I stop this?

## Answer

By default, the platform can send activation and default configuration commands.

Disable it in Admin Panel:

Settings → Service preferences → Device activation → Don't send default settings

This prevents the platform from sending default settings after activation.

It can also prevent SMS activation commands (if used).

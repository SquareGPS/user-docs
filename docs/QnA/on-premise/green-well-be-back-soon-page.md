# Green “We’ll be back soon” page

### Question

What does the green “We’ll be back soon” page mean?

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Unknown image (144)>)

### Answer

This "green" error is typically a consequence of the `api-server` service being inoperable.

Check:

`systemctl status api-server`

Restart:

`systemctl start api-server`

If the service is working normally, another common reason is incorrect domain configuration. For example, the domain name set in Admin Panel does not match what is configured in Nginx. Validate the domain settings to locate the mismatch.

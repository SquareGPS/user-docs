# Why isn't my model connecting to standalone?

### Question

Why isn’t my specific device model connecting, while other models work?

### Answer

If you have a specific device model that won’t connect to your platform (for example, Teltonika), while other models work, the most likely cause is a closed port.

Example: Teltonika typically uses port **47776**.

Verify from an external host:

`nc -zv your_domain.com 47776`

Open the required port, then retest.

For a full list of ports, search for the device model on the device list page.

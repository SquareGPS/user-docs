The following ports are used:

* 80 and 443 - for http/https connections, e.g. for client access or API operation
* 8383 - for websockets operation in Air console

{% hint style="info" %}
You do not need to open the entire pool of ports to connect devices. You can reduce the list of ports to only the necessary ones - check which ports your devices use on our website: [https://www.navixy.com/devices/](https://www.navixy.com/devices/)

### What external resources does the platform use?

During its operation, the platform accesses the following external network resources:

* auth.navixy.com and httpauth.navixy.com - licensing server;
* sms.navixy.com - push notification server;
* geocoder.navixy.com - geocoding server (converting coordinates to addresses);
* {a,b,c}-tiles.x-gpsmail.com, tiles.x-gpsmail.com - OSM map data server (map tiles);

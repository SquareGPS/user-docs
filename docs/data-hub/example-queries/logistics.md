# Logistics



Logistics is a complex ecosystem involving the coordination of transport, warehouse operations, inventory, and delivery execution. Integrating telematics into logistics processes allows companies to collect real-time data on vehicles, drivers, routes, and cargo conditions, which significantly improves decision-making and operational efficiency.

Navixy Data Hub, with its robust data ingestion and time-series analytics capabilities, supports the digital transformation of logistics operations by enabling deep visibility into each lifecycle stage. Its robust telematics ingestion capabilities, provides comprehensive visibility into these operations. Real-time GPS data, sensor data diagnostics, geofencing, and sensor analytics allow logistics operators to digitize workflows, automate controls, and make informed decisions.

## **Asset Tracking Without Movement** <a href="#asset-tracking-without-movement" id="asset-tracking-without-movement"></a>

This case identifies assets (e.g., vehicles or trailers) that have not changed their GPS compare the **minimum and maximum coordinates** during the period. If both values fall within a very narrow range (a tolerance threshold, e.g., ±0.01 degrees), we flag the asset as non-moving. The query also joins with the objects and vehicles tables in raw\_business\_data to retrieve meaningful asset labels for the result output.

```sql
WITH gps_bounds AS (
    SELECT
        td.device_id,
        MIN(td.latitude) AS min_lat,
        MAX(td.latitude) AS max_lat,
        MIN(td.longitude) AS min_lon,
        MAX(td.longitude) AS max_lon,
        COUNT(*) AS location_records
    FROM raw_telematics_data.tracking_data_core td
    WHERE td.device_time >= now() - interval '48 hours'
    GROUP BY td.device_id
),
stationary_devices AS (
    SELECT
        device_id
    FROM gps_bounds
    WHERE location_records > 10 -- exclude devices with very sparse data
	AND((max_lat - min_lat) <= 2000 -- ~10 meters
		OR
      	(max_lon - min_lon) <= 1000  -- ~10 meters
    		)
SELECT
    v.vehicle_id,
    v.vehicle_label,
    o.object_id,
    o.object_label,
    sd.device_id,
    gb.min_lat / 1e7 AS latitude,
    gb.min_lon / 1e7 AS longitude,
    gb.location_records
FROM stationary_devices sd
JOIN gps_bounds gb ON sd.device_id = gb.device_id
JOIN raw_business_data.objects o ON o.device_id = sd.device_id
LEFT JOIN raw_business_data.vehicles v ON v.object_id = o.object_id
ORDER BY gb.location_records DESC;
```

## **Vehicle Downtime Analysis** <a href="#vehicle-downtime-analysis" id="vehicle-downtime-analysis"></a>

This case focuses on analyzing how long vehicles are non-operational due to maintenance, breakdowns, or inactivity. Downtime metrics are crucial for logistics operations to monitor fleet health, reduce idle time, and improve overall utilization and scheduling efficiency.

The core of the downtime analysis lies in leveraging the vehicle\_service\_tasks table from raw\_business\_data, which logs both **planned and unplanned maintenance events**. Each task contains a start\_date and an end\_date, representing the downtime period. By filtering for **completed service tasks**, we can compute the exact duration each vehicle was out of operation.

The query calculates total downtime per vehicle by summing up the durations of all its service tasks (in hours). It also allows breakdown by planned vs unplanned maintenance by using the is\_unplanned flag. To make the results more actionable, it joins with the vehicles table to include vehicle labels, registration numbers, and model information.

```sql
WITH downtime_durations AS (
    SELECT
        vst.vehicle_id,
        vst.is_unplanned,
        vst.start_date,
        vst.end_date,
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (vst.end_date - vst.start_date))/3600 AS downtime_hours
    FROM raw_business_data.vehicle_service_tasks vst
    WHERE vst.status = 'done'
      AND vst.start_date IS NOT NULL
      AND vst.end_date IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
    v.vehicle_id,
    v.vehicle_label,
    v.registration_number,
    v.model,
    COUNT(dd.*) AS total_service_events,
    SUM(dd.downtime_hours) AS total_downtime_hours,
    SUM(dd.downtime_hours) FILTER (WHERE dd.is_unplanned = TRUE) AS unplanned_downtime_hours,
    SUM(dd.downtime_hours) FILTER (WHERE dd.is_unplanned = FALSE) AS planned_downtime_hours
FROM downtime_durations dd
JOIN raw_business_data.vehicles v ON v.vehicle_id = dd.vehicle_id
GROUP BY v.vehicle_id, v.vehicle_label, v.registration_number, v.model
ORDER BY total_downtime_hours DESC;
```

## **Route Deviation Detection** <a href="#route-deviation-detection" id="route-deviation-detection"></a>

This case identifies instances where vehicles deviate from their assigned or expected routes — particularly geofenced zones or delivery corridors. Tracking such deviations helps in ensuring route compliance, reducing delays, detecting risky driving behavior, and maintaining delivery SLAs.

This logic compares the vehicle’s actual GPS positions from tracking\_data\_core (in the raw\_telematics\_data schema) against predefined geographic zones from the zones table in raw\_business\_data. These zones represent assigned routes or route segments. Using geometric comparisons via ST\_DWithin, we determine whether a point is inside or outside the buffered route area.

The query joins each GPS position with every known route zone using a spatial **CROSS JOIN**, then applies ST\_DWithin() to check if the vehicle was within the permitted corridor. We isolate the rows where the vehicle was **outside all geofenced routes** and flag them as deviations. The final output lists these deviations, including the device, timestamp, vehicle label, and how far the point was from the nearest zone center.

```sql
WITH positions AS (
    SELECT
        td.device_id,
        td.device_time,
        o.object_id,
        o.object_label,
        z.zone_id,
        z.zone_label,
        ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(td.longitude / 1e7, td.latitude / 1e7), 4326)::geography AS gps_point,
        ST_Buffer(
            ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(z.circle_center_longitude, z.circle_center_latitude), 4326)::geography,
            z.radius
        ) AS route_buffer
    FROM raw_telematics_data.tracking_data_core td
    JOIN raw_business_data.objects o ON td.device_id = o.device_id
    CROSS JOIN raw_business_data.zones z
    WHERE td.device_time >= now() - interval '2 days'
),
evaluated AS (
    SELECT
        device_id,
        device_time,
        object_id,
        object_label,
        zone_id,
        zone_label,
        NOT ST_DWithin(gps_point, route_buffer, 0) AS is_deviation,
        ST_Distance(gps_point, route_buffer) AS deviation_distance_meters
    FROM positions
),
deviations_only AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM evaluated
    WHERE is_deviation = true
)
SELECT
    device_id,
    object_label,
    zone_label,
    device_time,
    deviation_distance_meters
FROM deviations_only
ORDER BY device_time DESC;
```

## **Engine Hours Summary per Vehicle / Driver / Day (Last 7 Days)** <a href="#engine-hours-summary-per-vehicle-driver-day-last-7-days" id="engine-hours-summary-per-vehicle-driver-day-last-7-days"></a>

This case measures how long engines were active for each vehicle on a daily basis, allowing fleet managers to track **utilization**, identify **overuse or underuse**, and correlate activity with driver assignments. When tied to drivers, it also supports **labor hour validation** and **performance analysis**.

The states table in raw\_telematics\_data records **time-series engine state indicators**, typically with a state\_name like 'ignition' and a value of 1 (on) or 0 (off). To calculate engine hours, we find all timestamped transitions for each device and compute durations where the engine was on (1).

To tie engine activity to both **vehicles and drivers**, we use the objects, vehicles, and driver\_history tables from raw\_business\_data. We associate each state record to the current driver on that object (via driver assignment history) and to the corresponding vehicle. We then group the data by day, vehicle, and driver, summing total active engine time (in hours).

   FROM inputs_core i
   LEFT JOIN raw_business_data.sensor_description sd
       ON sd.input_label = i.sensor_name

## **Temperature (and Humidity) Violation Events in the Last 7 Days** <a href="#temperature-and-humidity-violation-events-in-the-last-7-days" id="temperature-and-humidity-violation-events-in-the-last-7-days"></a>

This case identifies sensor readings — such as **temperature or humidity** — that exceed critical thresholds during transport. Monitoring such violations is vital for industries transporting perishable goods (e.g., food, pharmaceuticals) to ensure compliance with cold chain requirements and to prevent spoilage.

This query extracts **sensor input data** from the inputs table in the raw\_telematics\_data schema. Each row represents a sensor reading (e.g., temperature, humidity) recorded at a specific timestamp by a device. We filter these records to include only those from the **last 7 days**.

The main filtering logic is based on **sensor name patterns** and a comparison of their **numeric values against thresholds** (e.g., >25°C for temperature, >80% for humidity). Because value is stored as text, we cast it to numeric before applying the threshold conditions. To enrich the results, we join with the objects table to retrieve vehicle or asset labels, which improves interpretability for fleet managers.

   SELECT

## **Unauthorized Stops (Last 24 Hours)** <a href="#unauthorized-stops-last-24-hours" id="unauthorized-stops-last-24-hours"></a>

This case identifies **unauthorized or unplanned stops** made by vehicles within the past 24 hours. It helps in detecting potential violations of delivery routes, unauthorized breaks, or idle time that may affect fuel efficiency and SLA performance.

The query analyzes **location points with low or zero speed** using the The query uses the tracking\_data\_core table from raw\_telematics\_data to extract time-series location data and speed. A stop is detected when **speed drops below 3 km/h** for a duration of **more than 2 minutes**. Using LAG and LEAD functions, the query segments these low-speed periods to determine stop start and end timestamps.

To detect **unauthorized stops**, it filters out locations that fall within known **geofenced zones** (zones table) using PostGIS's ST\_DWithin. Only stops **outside of any zone buffer** are reported. The result includes vehicle ID, object label, registration, timestamps, duration, and coordinates for each stop.

## **Off-Hour Usage Detection** <a href="#off-hour-usage-detection" id="off-hour-usage-detection"></a>

This case identifies instances where vehicles are operated **outside normal business hours** — defined here as **Monday through Friday, 09:00–18:00**. Such detections are essential for flagging **unauthorized use**, identifying potential **vehicle misuse**, and improving **asset security**.

The logic is built on the tracking\_data\_core table from raw\_telematics\_data, which logs timestamped GPS events per device. We derive local **day of week** and **hour of use** from each device\_time entry and filter for records **outside the defined business window** (i.e., before 9 AM, after 6 PM, or any time on weekends).

To provide clarity, we enrich the GPS data with object and vehicle metadata from raw\_business\_data (e.g., vehicle label, registration, object ID). For more meaningful summaries, we optionally aggregate the usage to count **how many off-hour events** occurred per vehicle and when they happened. This can help in identifying patterns or repeat offenders.

## **Trip counts per day** <a href="#trip-counts-per-day" id="trip-counts-per-day"></a>

This case measures **how many trips** each vehicle completes daily and how far they travel, helping logistics teams assess **vehicle usage**, optimize routes, and detect anomalies like incomplete trips or unreported usage.

To define a **trip**, we use a change in **vehicle movement state** — i.e., transition from stopped to moving and back to stopped. Using the speed values from the tracking\_data\_core table, the query segments the data based on these transitions. A trip is identified as a **continuous movement period** where the speed stays above a threshold (e.g., >5 km/h).

Each trip includes:

* A **start timestamp and location** (first moving point)
* An **end timestamp and location** (last moving point before stopping)
* The **Haversine distance** between start and end locations

We calculate the trip count and total distance per day per vehicle, optionally enriched with vehicle labels from the vehicles table.

## **Mileage Count per Vehicle per Day (Last 7 Days)** <a href="#mileage-count-per-vehicle-per-day-last-7-days" id="mileage-count-per-vehicle-per-day-last-7-days"></a>

This case calculates the **daily mileage** (in kilometers) for each vehicle over the last 7 days. It is fundamental for tracking **vehicle utilization**, monitoring **fuel efficiency**, planning **maintenance**, and detecting underuse or overuse.

We extract all GPS records from tracking\_data\_core for the past 7 days. Each GPS point has a timestamp, latitude, and longitude. For each vehicle and each day, we:

1. **Sort GPS points chronologically** per device.
2. **Calculate distance between consecutive points** using the Haversine formula.
3. **Sum the distances per day per device** to get total mileage.

This approach provides high accuracy without relying on external odometer sensors. Optionally, the query joins with objects and vehicles to enrich results with asset metadata.

```sql
WITH gps_points AS (
    SELECT
        td.device_id,
        td.device_time,
        td.device_time::date AS trip_day,

    FROM gps_points
    WHERE prev_lat IS NOT NULL AND prev_lon IS NOT NULL
      AND ABS(lat - prev_lat) < 1 AND ABS(lon - prev_lon) < 1 -- exclude outliers
)
SELECT
    v.vehicle_label,
    v.registration_number,
    o.object_label,
    d.device_id,

## **Vehicle Event Log Report** <a href="#vehicle-event-log-report" id="vehicle-event-log-report"></a>

This case provides a comprehensive report of all **vehicle-related events** (e.g., ignition, door open, harsh braking, etc.) across the fleet. It includes **event type**, **timestamp**, and **vehicle context**, allowing operations teams to audit behavior, track abnormal activity, or drive alerts and analytics.

The primary source is the states table from the raw\_telematics\_data schema. Each row includes: device\_id (source of the event), device\_time (timestamp), state\_name (event label), and value (status or measurement).

To create a usable report:

1. We extract all records from the last 7 days.
2. Group them by **event type**, **vehicle**, and **date** to provide a **count of how often each event occurred** and **when it occurred**.
3. Enrich the results with vehicle metadata (vehicle\_label, registration\_number, object\_label) via objects and vehicles.

This gives a **daily event timeline** across the fleet - essential for diagnostics, behavioral analysis, and proactive maintenance.

WITH raw_events AS (
    SELECT
        s.device_id,
        s.device_time,

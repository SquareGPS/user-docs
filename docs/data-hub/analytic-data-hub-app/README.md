# Analytics App

The **Analytics App** provides a web-based interface for exploring analytical capabilities available through your Data Hub. Built on Python and Streamlit framework, this application demonstrates capabilities and advantages of the Data Hub such as flexible analytical solutions tailored to your operational requirements.

## Your analytical journey: templates to custom insights

Start with immediate operational needs, discover patterns that reveal optimization opportunities, then build solutions that address your unique business challenges.

## Main menu items

Users can start their journey in the Data analytics using predefined dashboards and reports covered common use cases and expectations or explore custom data retrievals for further analysis.

### Real-time operational intelligence

**Dashboards** provide immediate visibility of the monitoring objects its statuses, attributes and values.

Data Hub contains near realtime data needed for general operations. In this section you can find three dashboards showcasting insights and context for different purposed. Those provide info with the latest custom calculated **movement and connection statuses** of the monitoring objects, **sensor data values** and the assets intelligence summary table which includes business and telematics data last statuses in one place.

### Historical pattern analysis

**Reports** reveal optimization opportunities across time periods through [historical reports](../data-hub/analytic-data-hub-app/historical-reports.md). Measurement Sensor Report identifies maintenance patterns through fuel, temperature and other types of sensors for deep analysis. Object Activity Report gives a visibility of the pre-aggregated activities could have to identify route inefficiencies. Shifts Report analyzes workforce productivity.

### Custom analytical development

[Direct data access](custom-analysis-sql-configurator/) through SQL queries enables specialized solutions when standard reports or dashboards don't address specific needs. Database Schema browser displays available data relationships. SQL Query Execution allows complex analysis. Custom visualization creation provides drag-and-drop chart building.

Advance here for targeted solutions addressing unique operational requirements.

## Evaluate your requirements

Experience these analytical capabilities to determine whether these templates and visuals are enough with the insights presented or you need more deep insights and comprehensive analytics:

* **Continue using this application** if standard dashboards and reports address your operational requirements, and occasional custom analysis meets specialized needs.
* **Explore other BI solutions** if you need enterprise security, automated reporting systems, advanced visualization performance, or organization-wide analytical access.

Use hands-on experience to make informed decisions about analytical infrastructure. For production options, see [BI tools selection guide](../data-hub/connection-setup/selecting-bi-tools/).

## Supporting resources

Access comprehensive documentation and technical guidance to maximize your analytical capabilities and optimize system performance:

* [Data schema overview](../data-hub/schema-overview/) explains data structure and relationships.
* [Example queries](../example-queries/) provides proven analytical patterns and optimization techniques.
* [Settings and configuration](../data-hub/analytic-data-hub-app/settings-and-configuration.md) covers performance optimization and configuration options.

Transform from reactive coordination to proactive, data-driven management. Discover how analytical capabilities evolve from immediate insights to strategic optimization while building understanding of production infrastructure requirements.

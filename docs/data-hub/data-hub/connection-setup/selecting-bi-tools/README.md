# Selecting BI tools

Analyzing and visualizing data stored in your Private Telematics Lakehouse requires appropriate Business Intelligence (BI) tools. This section helps you understand available options, their strengths and limitations, and how to make the right choice for your organization.

## Why use BI tools with your data warehouse

While direct SQL access provides flexibility for data exploration, BI tools offer significant advantages:

* **Visual analytics** that make complex data more understandable
* **Interactive dashboards** for real-time monitoring of key metrics
* **Scheduled reporting** to automate insights delivery
* **Data exploration** tools for non-technical users
* **Sharing capabilities** to distribute findings across your organization

The right BI tool transforms raw data into actionable insights, supporting better business decisions without requiring deep technical knowledge.

## Comparison of recommended BI tools

We've evaluated three powerful options that work well with the Private Telematics Lakehouse: Power BI, Apache Superset, and Streamlit. Each offers distinct advantages depending on your requirements, technical capabilities, and budget.

## Selecting the right tool for your needs

### Choose Power BI if:

* You already use Microsoft 365
* You need ready-made solutions without programming
* Enterprise-level support is important
* You require simple access management
* You need quick installation and configuration

Power BI excels in corporate environments where integration with Microsoft products is valuable and where users prefer a polished, ready-to-use solution without extensive technical setup.

### Choose Apache Superset if:

* You need complete customization
* Open source is important
* You have technical specialists available
* Scalability is required
* You need support for multiple database types

Apache Superset is ideal for organizations that value flexibility and control over their BI infrastructure, have technical resources available, and prefer not to be tied to proprietary software.

### Choose Streamlit if:

* You need maximum flexibility
* You have Python developers on staff
* You require rapid prototype development
* Integration with Python libraries is important
* You need to incorporate ML models into your dashboards

Streamlit works best for data science teams that want to quickly create custom visualizations and interactive applications, especially when machine learning or advanced analytics are involved.

# Workflow YAML reference

This page documents the YAML format that [Transformation Builder](transformation-builder.md) uses for exporting and importing workflows. Use this reference when you need to share workflows between environments, store them in version control, or integrate with external runtime systems.

The format has two versions. **Version 2** is the current format that Transformation Builder produces on export. It organizes nodes as a flat array in topological order (`cte_nodes`) with a separate `edges` array for connections. **Version 1** is an older format that uses a `nodes` key with inline `depends_on` references for connections. Transformation Builder can import both versions, but always exports version 2.

{% columns %}
{% column %}
#### **Export**&#x20;

Produces a YAML file in version 2 format. You can trigger an export from the **Export** button in the Transformation Builder toolbar, or through the API. The exported file can be stored in a repository, shared with colleagues, or passed to an external runtime for execution.
{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
#### **Import**&#x20;

Accepts both version 2 (the current format) and version 1 (an earlier format with `depends_on`-based connections). Use the **Import** function in the Builder and select a `.yaml` or `.yml` file.
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

## How the export is formed

The export generator builds the YAML file through four steps:

1. **Topological sort of nodes.** The graph of nodes and edges is sorted so that source nodes come first, followed by transformation nodes in dependency order, and finally the Output node. If the graph contains a cycle, a fallback order (by node list position) is used.
2. **Source list per node.** For each node, the generator collects an ordered list of predecessor node IDs from the edges where `target` equals the current node's ID. For example, an SQL Transform node with two inputs will have a `sources` list containing exactly two IDs in the correct order.
3. **cte\_nodes array.** Each node is written as a record in the `cte_nodes` array, in topological order. See [cte\_nodes structure](workflow-yaml-reference.md#cte_nodes-structure) below for field details.
4. **Top-level YAML assembly.** The generator combines the `cte_nodes` array with the edges list, workflow metadata, and optional fields (viewport, schedule) into the final document.

### Top-level keys

The root of a version 2 YAML file contains the following keys:

| Key              | Presence                   | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`        | Always                     | Format version number. Always `2` for current exports.                                                                  |
| `name`           | Always                     | Workflow name.                                                                                                          |
| `description`    | Always                     | Workflow description. May be an empty string.                                                                           |
| `cte_nodes`      | Always                     | Array of node records in topological order. See [cte\_nodes structure](workflow-yaml-reference.md#cte_nodes-structure). |
| `edges`          | Always                     | Array of edge objects. See [edges structure](workflow-yaml-reference.md#edges-structure).                               |
| `output_node_id` | When an Output node exists | The ID of the Output node in the workflow.                                                                              |
| `viewport`       | When set in the workflow   | Canvas position and zoom level: `{ x, y, zoom }`. Used to restore the visual layout on import.                          |
| `schedule`       | When schedule is enabled   | Execution schedule: `{ cron, timezone }`. Default cron is `0 0 * * *`, default timezone is `UTC`.                       |

### cte\_nodes structure

Each entry in the `cte_nodes` array represents one node in the workflow graph.

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`              | Unique node identifier (string).                                                                                                                                                           |
| `type`            | Node type. One of: `telematics`, `business`, `filter`, `resample`, `sql`, `arithmetic`, `custom`, `output`.                                                                                |
| `label`           | Display name shown on the canvas. Falls back to the node ID if not set.                                                                                                                    |
| `description`     | Node description. May be an empty string.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `position`        | Canvas coordinates as `{ x, y }`.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `sources`         | Ordered list of predecessor node IDs, derived from the graph edges. Empty for source nodes.                                                                                                |
| `params`          | Node configuration parameters. The specific fields depend on the node type. See the [Transformation Builder](transformation-builder.md) documentation for parameter details per node type. |
| `width`, `height` | Optional. Canvas dimensions for the node, included only when explicitly set.                                                                                                               |

**Params cleaning.** The `available_tables` and `available_columns` fields are removed from `params` during export. These fields are populated at runtime when the Builder connects to the database and should not be stored in YAML.

**SQL type with multiple sources.** When a node of type `sql` has two or more sources, the export adds a `join_spec` field to the record. This is an array with one element containing the join configuration:

```yaml
join_spec:
  - type: "left"       # join type (lowercase): left, inner, right, full
    on_condition: "a_node_telematics_1.device_id = a_node_business_1.device_id"
```

The `type` value is taken from the node's `join_type` parameter (converted to lowercase), and `on_condition` is taken from `join_condition`. For SQL nodes with two sources, the join information appears in both `params` and `join_spec`.

### edges structure

The `edges` array defines connections between nodes in the workflow graph.

```yaml
edges:
  - source: "node-telematics-1"
    target: "node-sql-1"
  - source: "node-business-1"
    target: "node-sql-1"
```

Each edge is an object with two fields:

| Field    | Description                                   |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `source` | The ID of the node where the edge originates. |
| `target` | The ID of the node where the edge terminates. |

Edge IDs from the Builder interface are not preserved in the export. On import, new edge IDs are generated automatically.

## Import

### Version detection

The Builder determines the YAML format version using the following logic:

* If the root contains `version: 2` or the key `cte_nodes`, the file is processed as **version 2**.
* Otherwise, **version 1** is expected.

### Version 2 import

The Builder iterates the `cte_nodes` array in order. For each record:

* The `id` and `type` are read. The type is converted to lowercase. Nodes with type `python` are skipped without raising an error.
* Parameters are read from the `params` key (or `config` as a fallback). For `sql`-type nodes, if a `join_spec` field is present in the record, it is assigned to the node's join configuration.
* The `edges` array is parsed into source-target pairs, and new edge IDs are generated.
* The `viewport` and `schedule` fields are preserved if present in the YAML.

### Version 1 import (backward compatibility)

Version 1 files use a `nodes` key (array or dictionary) and optionally an `edges` array or `depends_on` fields within each node.

The Builder processes version 1 files as follows:

* Supported node types are the same as version 2: `telematics`, `business`, `filter`, `resample`, `sql`, `arithmetic`, `custom`, `output`.
* Connections between nodes can be defined in two ways: a top-level `edges` array, or a `depends_on` list within each node.
* The `inputs` and `outputs` fields on each node are normalized to objects with `{ name, type }` structure.
* If edges include `sourceHandle` or `targetHandle` port identifiers, the import adjusts node ports accordingly for correct display in the Builder interface.

## YAML structure template

The following template shows the complete structure of a version 2 YAML file with annotations:

{% code expandable="true" %}
```yaml
version: 2
name: "workflow_name"
description: "Workflow description"

cte_nodes:
  - id: "node-id-1"
    type: telematics    # telematics | business | filter | resample |
                        # sql | arithmetic | custom | output
    label: "Node display name"
    description: ""
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 }
    sources: []         # empty for source nodes
    params:
      table_name: "tracking_data_core"
      time_column: "device_time"
      columns: [device_id, device_time, speed]
      filter_condition: ""
      time_window_minutes: ""

  - id: "node-id-2"
    type: sql
    label: "SQL Transform"
    description: ""
    position: { x: 400, y: 160 }
    sources: ["node-id-1", "node-id-3"]   # ordered predecessor IDs
    params:
      join_type: LEFT
      join_condition: "a_node_id_1.device_id = a_node_id_3.device_id"
      select_columns: ["a_node_id_1.*", "a_node_id_3.sensor_label"]
    join_spec:                             # added for sql nodes with 2+ sources
      - type: "left"
        on_condition: "a_node_id_1.device_id = a_node_id_3.device_id"

    # optional per-node fields:
    # width: 250
    # height: 400

edges:
  - source: "node-id-1"
    target: "node-id-2"
  - source: "node-id-3"
    target: "node-id-2"

# optional top-level fields:
output_node_id: "node-output-1"           # if an Output node exists
viewport: { x: 0, y: 0, zoom: 1 }        # canvas position on import
schedule: { cron: "0 0 * * *", timezone: "UTC" }  # if scheduling is enabled
```
{% endcode %}

### Example

The following example shows a complete version 2 workflow that reads telematics sensor data, joins it with sensor descriptions from the business schema, applies an arithmetic transformation to convert a column type, and writes the results to an output table.

{% code expandable="true" %}
```yaml
version: 2
name: enriched_vehicle_metrics
description: "Enriched vehicle metrics from telematics and sensor description"

cte_nodes:
  - id: node-telematics-1
    type: telematics
    label: "Raw data: Telematics"
    description: ""
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 }
    sources: []
    params:
      table_name: inputs
      time_column: device_time
      columns: [device_id, device_time, value]
      filter_condition: ""
      time_window_minutes: ""

  - id: node-business-1
    type: business
    label: "Raw data: Business"
    description: ""
    position: { x: 100, y: 220 }
    sources: []
    params:
      table_name: sensor_description
      key_column: sensor_id
      columns: [sensor_id, device_id, sensor_label]

  - id: node-sql-1
    type: sql
    label: "SQL Transform"
    description: ""
    position: { x: 400, y: 160 }
    sources: [node-telematics-1, node-business-1]
    params:
      join_type: LEFT
      join_condition: "a_node_telematics_1.device_id = a_node_business_1.device_id"
      select_columns: ["a_node_telematics_1.*", "a_node_business_1.sensor_label"]
    join_spec:
      - type: "left"
        on_condition: "a_node_telematics_1.device_id = a_node_business_1.device_id"

  - id: node-arithmetic-1
    type: arithmetic
    label: "Arithmetic"
    description: ""
    position: { x: 700, y: 160 }
    sources: [node-sql-1]
    params:
      expressions:
        - column: value
          expression: "value::numeric"
          expression_alias: value_num

  - id: node-output-1
    type: output
    label: "Output"
    description: ""
    position: { x: 1000, y: 160 }
    sources: [node-arithmetic-1]
    params:
      table_name: enriched_vehicle_metrics
      time_column: device_time
      primary_key: [device_id, device_time]
      write_mode: append

edges:
  - { source: node-telematics-1, target: node-sql-1 }
  - { source: node-business-1, target: node-sql-1 }
  - { source: node-sql-1, target: node-arithmetic-1 }
  - { source: node-arithmetic-1, target: node-output-1 }

output_node_id: node-output-1
viewport: { x: 0, y: 0, zoom: 1 }
schedule: { cron: "0 0 * * *", timezone: "UTC" }
```
{% endcode %}

This workflow performs the following steps:

1. **node-telematics-1** reads `device_id`, `device_time`, and `value` columns from the `inputs` table in the `raw_telematics_data` schema.
2. **node-business-1** reads `sensor_id`, `device_id`, and `sensor_label` from the `sensor_description` table in the `raw_business_data` schema.
3. **node-sql-1** joins the two sources on `device_id` using a `LEFT JOIN`, selecting all telematics columns plus the `sensor_label` from the business source.
4. **node-arithmetic-1** adds a computed column `value_num` by casting the text `value` column to a numeric type.
5. **node-output-1** configures the result to be written to the `enriched_vehicle_metrics` table with `append` mode, using `device_id` and `device_time` as the primary key.

{% hint style="info" %}
The export does not include `available_tables` or `available_columns` in `params`. These fields are populated dynamically when the Builder connects to the database. For SQL nodes with two sources, join information appears in both `params` and `join_spec`.

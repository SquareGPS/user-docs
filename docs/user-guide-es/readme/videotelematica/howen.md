Howen Technologies specializes in Vehicle Service Systems (VSS) with a focus on cost-effective, AI-enhanced video telematics solutions. Their devices feature expandable capabilities including facial recognition, driver monitoring, and advanced driver assistance systems.

Integrating Howen VSS with Navixy combines video surveillance with fleet management in one interface. Let's explore how to implement this integration and embed the Howen VSS dashboard into your Navixy interface.

#### Embedding Howen VSS in Navixy UI

At this step, we perform the actual integration by embedding the Howen VSS dashboard into your Navixy interface.

Navixy offers [User applications](broken-reference) functionality that allows embedding 3rd-party apps directly in the platform's interface. We will use it to embed Howen VSS.
